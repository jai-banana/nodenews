(AP) -- Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration plans to continue flying migrants who entered the country illegally to Democratic strongholds, his spokeswoman said Saturday, a day after newly released records showed the state paid nearly $1 million to arrange two sets of flights to Delaware and Illinois.\n\nDocuments released Friday show that the two sets of planned flights will transport about 100 migrants to those two states. They were scheduled to happen before Oct. 3 but apparently were halted or postponed. The contractor hired by Florida later extended the window for the trips until Dec. 1, according to memos released by the state Department of Transportation.\n\nWhen asked why they flights were postponed, DeSantis' communications director, Taryn Fenske, noted that Florida has been busy dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Picture: Istock\n\nNext to a wall surrounding an empty lot in central Johannesburg, a cherry picker carries a man above the street.\n\nHe is not repairing power lines, but instead, spray painting a canvas larger than a billboard with portraits of four contemporary South African musicians.\n\nKnown as Dbongz, the artist is at the vanguard of a growing movement that has embraced Johannesburg's grit to create paintings that have helped the once-neglected city centre spring back to life.\n\n\"(The city) used to be dull, mundane and at the same time dodgy,\" said the 32-year-old.\n\n\"But because of colour, because of these lively murals that we paint, people start seeing it as a place they can go into.\"\n\nWhat was an artists' pastime has increasingly become a business, with real estate firms to commissioning artworks to give their buildings a facelift.\n\nIn some neighbourhoods, walls around every corner have been given a splash of colour.\n\nIn the 1990s, Johannesburg's city centre notoriously descended into a period of blight and abandonment.\n\nAlready hollowed by sanctions in the 1980s, the advent of democracy in 1994 was met with the flight of white-owned businesses to high-walled suburbs.\n\nEntire blocks were left empty. Hotels simply bricked over their doors, without even bothering to auction off the contents.\n\nIn the early 2000s, property entrepreneurs returned and started experimenting.\n\nALSO READ: More stylish than ever, eyeglass chains are getting a new lease on life\n\nCity Property, a real estate firm, bought up several abandoned office towers to convert them into affordable housing.\n\nStuck with an old, tiled wall facing the street, the company commissioned South African artist Hannelie Coetzee to revitalise it.\n\n\"Cities are cold, concrete, very gridded-up places. Art brings a bit of a soft edge, or a thought-provoking moment that you might not expect,\" she said.\n\n\"That for me is the magic thing about public art. It creates meaning through the artists' voice, for a specific city.\"\n\nShe created a 166-square-metre portrait of a woman, crafted from more than 2,000 plates, saucers and bowls.\n\nThe woman's sweep of hair was inspired by how South African women today are adapting traditional hairstyles into trendy new looks.\n\nDeveloper Adam Levy handed a 10-storey building to American artist Shepard Fairey, best known for his iconic \"Hope\" portrait of Barack Obama.\n\nAn exposed wall became a portrait of Nelson Mandela towering over the city.\n\nArtistic improvements serve as subliminal cues to visitors that someone is caring for the neighbourhood, said Levy.\n\n\"Now it's so patently evident that there is a system behind the scenes that cares about what's going on here. And I think people can open up in that space,\" Levy said.\n\n\"They feel comfortable and safe. They feel well looked after and appreciated.\"\n\nOver the past decade, brands have waded into the sector, commissioning murals for advertising purposes, said Marcel Swain, a head of marketing at Heineken South Africa, which recently held a street art competition.\n\nGraffiti artists can be paid thousands of rand for a piece, he said.\n\nDbongz has become one of Johannesburg's most recognisable street artists. His works have become a visual trademark for the city and have inspired a wave of others.\n\nDbongz's latest mural was commissioned by Apple Music to showcase vocalist Simphiwe Dana, folk guitarist Bongeziwe Mabandla, jazz musician Mandisi Dyantyis and amapiano sensation Nobuhle.\n\nThe musicians' faces are painted in black and white but their clothing and jewellery jumps out in vivid colours, against a bright green backdrop in patterns inspired by traditional textiles.\n\nThe artwork speaks to another set of portraits of deceased musicians he painted on massive concrete pillars supporting a double-decker highway cutting through the Newtown cultural district.\n\nBorn in a township on the western outskirts of the city, the artist is also known for his work in impoverished areas, where he sometimes paints neighbourhood children on large walls.\n\n\"It gets people to believe in themselves and see themselves in a bigger light, bigger than what it is that's happening in their lives,\" he said.","source":{"uri":"citizen.co.za","dataType":"news","title":"The Citizen"},"authors":[{"uri":"agence_france_presse@citizen.co.za","name":"Agence France-Presse","type":"author","isAgency":true}],"image":"https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Johannesburg-e1665861547960.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.02745098039215688,"wgt":403559040,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226459614","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:43:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:43:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:27:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/15/nation/democrats-spent-2-trillion-save-economy-they-dont-want-talk-about-it/","title":"Democrats spent $2 trillion to save the economy. They don't want to talk about it. - The Boston Globe","body":"But this year, as Warnock is locked in a tight reelection campaign, he barely talks about those checks.\n\nDemocratic candidates in competitive Senate races this fall have spent little time on the trail or the airwaves touting the centerpiece provisions of their party's $1.9 trillion economic rescue package, which party leaders had hoped would help stave off losses in the House and Senate in midterm elections. In part, that is because the rescue plan has become fodder for Republicans to attack Democrats over rapidly rising prices, accusing them of overstimulating the economy with too much cash.\n\nThe economic aid, which was intended to help keep families afloat amid the pandemic, included two centerpiece components for households: the direct checks of up to $1,400 for lower- to middle-class individuals and an expanded child tax credit, worth up to $300 per child per month. It was initially seen as Biden's signature economic policy achievement, in part because the tax credit dramatically reduced child poverty last year. Polls suggested Americans knew they had received money and why -- giving Democrats hope they would be rewarded politically.\n\nLiberal activists are particularly troubled that Democratic candidates are not focusing more on the payments to families.\n\n\"It's a missed opportunity and a strategic mistake,\" said Chris Hughes, who is a founder of Facebook; a senior fellow at the Institute on Race, Power, and Political Economy at The New School; and a co-founder of the liberal policy group Economic Security Project Action. \"Our public polling and our experience suggest the child tax credit is a sleeper issue that could influence the election a lot more than a lot of candidates realized.\"\n\nCelinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has surveyed voters in detail on the child credit, said data suggest the party's candidates should be selling Americans on the pieces of Biden's policies that helped families cope with rising costs.\n\n\"We have a narrative on inflation,\" Lake said in an interview. \"We just aren't using it.\"\n\nMany campaign strategists disagree. They say voters are not responding to messages about pandemic aid. Some Democrats worry that voters have been swayed by the persistent Republican argument that the aid was the driving factor behind rapidly rising prices of food, rent and other daily staples.\n\nEconomists generally agree that the stimulus spending contributed to accelerating inflation, although they disagree on how much. Biden administration officials and Democratic candidates reject that characterization. When pressed, they defend their emergency spending, saying it has put the United States on stronger footing than other wealthy nations at a time of rapid global inflation.\n\nRepublicans have spent nearly $150 million on inflation-themed television ads across the country this election cycle, according to data from AdImpact.\n\nDemocrats have tried to deflect blame, portraying inflation as the product of global forces like crimped supply chains while touting their efforts to lower the cost of electricity and prescription drugs. They have aired nearly $50 million of their own ads mentioning inflation, often pinning it on corporate profit gouging. \"What if I told you shipping container companies have been making record profits while prices have been skyrocketing on you?\" Warnock said in an ad aired earlier this year.\n\nCandidates and independent groups that support the stimulus payments have spent just $7 million nationwide on advertisements mentioning the direct checks, the child tax credit or the rescue plan overall, according to data from AdImpact.\n\nFar more money has been spent by Democrats on other issues, including $27 million on ads mentioning infrastructure, which was another early economic win for Biden, and $95 million on ads that mention abortion rights.\n\nWarnock has not cited any of the rescue plan's provisions in his ads, focusing instead on issues like personal character, health care and bipartisanship, according to AdImpact data.\n\nFor months after the rescue plan's passage, Democratic leaders were confident that they had solved an economic policy dilemma that has vexed Democrats and Republicans stretching back to the George W. Bush administration: They were giving Americans money, but voters weren't giving them any credit.\n\nTax cuts and direct spending aid approved by Bush, President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump failed to win over large swaths of voters and spare incumbent parties from large midterm losses. Economists and strategists concluded that was often because Americans had not noticed they had benefited from the policies each president was sure would sway elections.\n\nThat was not the case with the direct checks and the child tax credit. People noticed them. But they still have not turned into political selling points at a time of rapid inflation.\n\nAs the November elections approach, most voters appear to be motivated by a long list of other issues, including abortion, crime and a range of economic concerns.\n\nWarnock's speech last week to a group of Democrats in an unfinished floor of an office space in Dunwoody, a northern Atlanta suburb, underscored that shift in emphasis.\n\nHe began the policy section of the rally with a quick nod to the child credit, then ticked through a series of provisions from bills that Biden has signed in the last two years: highways and broadband internet tied to a bipartisan infrastructure law, semiconductor plants spurred by a China competitiveness law, a gun safety law and aid for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. He lingered on one piece of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act: a cap on the cost of insulin for Medicare patients, which Warnock cast as critical for diabetics in Georgia, particularly in Black communities.\n\nDirect pandemic payments began under Trump and continued under Biden, with no serious talk of another round after the ones delivered in the rescue plan. Most Democrats had hoped the one-year, $100 billion child credit in the rescue plan would be made permanent in a new piece of legislation.\n\nBut the credit expired, largely because Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a key swing vote, opposed its inclusion in what would become the Inflation Reduction Act, citing concerns the additional money would exacerbate inflation.\n\nBiden's advisers say the rescue plan and its components aren't being deployed on the trail because other issues have overwhelmed them -- from Biden's long list of economic bills signed into law as well as the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that has galvanized the Democratic base.\n\nLake, the Democratic pollster, said talking more about the child credit could help reenergize Democratic voters for the midterms. Warnock's speech in Dunwoody -- an admittedly small sample -- suggested otherwise.\n\nWarnock drew cheers from the audience after he called the child tax credit \"the single largest tax cut for middle- and working-class families in American history.\"","source":{"uri":"bostonglobe.com","dataType":"news","title":"The Boston Globe"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg?d=364","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.2,"wgt":403558980,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226458577","lang":"spa","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:41:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:41:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:41:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://olfqnz.bitlydns.net/2022/10/15/carta-al-presidente-biden-potus-por-robert-alvarado-robertveraz/","title":"Carta al Presidente Biden @POTUS por Robert Alvarado @robertveraz","body":"\"Cuando los gobiernos temen a la gente, hay libertad. Cuando la gente teme al gobierno, hay tiranía\" Thomas Jefferson\n\nMuchas veces uno escribe cartas a muchas en forma abierta o privada a los líderes del mundo por la crisis política que está pasando Venezuela con ese éxodo que van más de siete millones de venezolanos que huyen de una dictadura, por la cual no se oye respuesta alguna, solo un silencio y una agonía vive en el escritor.\n\nPor eso llamó la atención la maravillosa obra de Gabriel García Márquez http://goo.gl/xcK4Jh \"El Coronel no tiene quien le escriba\". Un hombre de buena fe y bastante ingenuo, vive en su pueblo esperando 15 años para recibir su carta de jubilación, o sea, la pensión que le va a cambiar su fortuna. Con la inconformidad con un sistema gubernamental de la época en no recibir respuestas negativas o inesperadas de la vida cotidiana, ya El Coronel sintiendo temor, miedo o insatisfacción que más tarde en la narración de la novela se refleja en la resignación y la pérdida de la esperanza. Uno observa esta obra la triste realidad de muchas personas que escriben y no le responden caso que algunos manda cartas algún jefe de estado del país más poderoso como USA que en los archivos de ese país. Han mandado infinidades de cartas, la más famosa de Fidel Castro, cuando tenía 12 años, al entonces presidente de Estados Unidos, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Una que es negado por la Habana porque ellos nunca van a reconocer la veracidad de ella pero en meses atrás un venezolano le envía una carta al presidente de los Estados Unidos Barack Obama http://goo.gl/KSZh7M y le respondió en forma abierta como es a Pablo Medina, y la dio a conocer en una comunicación que recibiera por el entonces Presidente Obama, de fecha 5 de agosto de 2014 en la que manifiesta su preocupación por la situación política que vive Venezuela y afirma Pablo Medina antes los medios en esa carta Obama pidió por la liberación de los manifestantes detenidos en las cárceles venezolanas, pero la crisis se desbordó llegando que muchos venezolanos se fueran de Venezuela por diferentes país del continente americano y el expresidente Donald Trump le dio trato especial a todos los venezolanos que venían huyendo de este apartheid chavista producto de la corrupción administrativa ha existido siempre en el gobierno de Venezuela, solo que en la actual administración se exacerbó. El gobierno de la quinta república hace gala de métodos por demás creativos en eso de meter mano a las arcas públicas. Poniendo de un lado el concepto de que la política es una ciencia que se supone fue creada para servirle al ser humano, sin distingos de ninguna índole. Por eso se habla de procurar siempre el bien común, y para lograr tal objetivo son necesarias las ideas concentradas en proyectos viables y bien articulados. Si a ver vamos, el político de la V, i que revolucionario, dice ser un servidor del pueblo mientras es un gánster de la política algo muy notorio en esta mentada revolución que lo señala con supuestos vínculos con el narcotráfico. Por eso huyen los venezolanos dejando atrás a un país hermoso que se llama Venezuela. Con la búsqueda del sueño americano a las ideales que garantizan la oportunidad de prosperar y tener éxito en una sociedad moderna pero se acabó un 12 de octubre (día de Colón) cuando la administración de Joe Biden, nuevas medidas para controlar la migración venezolana: un programa que da estatus legal por dos años a quienes llegan en avión y la expulsión inmediata de la mayoría de quienes crucen la frontera por México.\n\nSé que Biden debe recordar aquellas frases del Pastor Martin Luther King dijo: Nunca olviden que todo lo que Hitler hizo en Alemania era legal para los jueces de ese país\". En Venezuela no hay estado derecho, unos norteamericanos fueron secuestrados por el mismo gobierno de Maduro y unos directivos de CITGO. Se hizo una permuta con los afortunados en el canje de prisioneros de Joe Biden y Nicolás Maduro. Los llamados narco sobrinos, a cambio de la excarcelación de siete estadounidenses detenidos en Venezuela. Eso se vio muy mal en el mundo, porque ellos siempre dicen que con terrorista no negocian, pero Joe Biden lo hizo obviando todas esas denuncias de violaciones derechos humanos y expropiaciones que una vez le dijeron a Chávez (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KXWQ7xh_-o) que era un ladrón en imponer ese socialismo maligno que corrió por toda América Latina.\n\nEsta actitud de Joe Biden es criticada por muchos norteamericanos, Senador Bob Menéndez pidió al presidente Biden recapacitar y no deportar a los migrantes venezolanos que ingresan de forma irregular por la frontera sur, luego de que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional anunció que aquellos venezolanos que \"intenten cruzar ilegalmente la frontera sur de Estados Unidos serán devueltos a México\". También dijo Menéndez \"No puedo apoyar ningún programa que cree requisitos adicionales para los venezolanos y a la vez se combine con una expansión injustificable del programa de deportación de Título 42 de Trump. Ampliar el Título 42 para incluir ahora a los venezolanos agrega sal a una herida abierta mientras se deteriora aún más nuestro sistema de asilo que el presidente Biden prometió restauraría\".\n\nJustamente el mismo día Joe Biden toma una nueva decisión sobre el tema de los migrantes venezolanos, fue publicada en las redes sociales de varios jóvenes de Barinitas, estado Barinas, habían vencido a la peligrosa selva de Darién y continuaban su camino hacia la tierra del Tío Sam. Anderson Ramírez es uno de los bariniteños que integra el grupo de aventureros, cuyo objetivo es alcanzar una mejor calidad de vida para ellos y sus familias. En estos momentos esos jóvenes paisanos míos estarán en un barco a la deriva sin rumbo fijo y pido que sean tomados en cuenta estos Jóvenes de Barinas lograron cruzar el Darién y avanzan rumbo a Estados Unidos\n\nEn esta carta Biden debe buscar alternativas a la crisis migratoria a través de un corredor humanitario, para migración ordenada y segura para los venezolanos y EEUU. 24 mil visas para mi es insuficiente para la magnitud del problema por la cantidad de venezolanos que salen del país. Una reconsideración es necesaria en ese aspecto que puso a muchos de mis compatriotas a echar carrera. Esas Medidas de protección humanitaria no deben dejarlos más desvalidos como ocurriría con venezolanos a merced de mafias en México por eso es mi desacuerdo presidente Biden.\n\nTérmino una frase \"La cima de la montaña\", el último discurso del Pastor Evangélico Martin Luther King (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOmYMBfcUm4) \"Dios me ha permitido llegar a la cima de la montaña. He mirado desde allí y he visto la tierra prometida. Pero es posible que no llegue allí con vosotros\", dijo el activista por los derechos civiles de los afroamericanos unas horas antes de recibir un balazo letal y su legado se mantiene y pido en esta carta al presidente de los Estados Unidos Joe Biden que rectifique...\n\nCualquier información o sugerencia por robertveraz@hotmail.com robertveraz@gmail.com grsndz629@gmail.com o bien por mí teléfono 0414-1574645 y además pueden leer esta columna en mí página Web: https://robertveraz4.webnode.es/ y sigan mis comentarios y opiniones por @robertveraz en twitter e Instagram.

It was a really good, enjoyable kind of fight,\" Hathaway said afterward. \"Obviously, everyone wishes they got the finish, but it was my first one out in eight years, so I kind of had to put the (work) in, go for the gears and figure out where I was. I'm sorry, everyone, I didn't get the finish. I tried my best, but obviously it's been a while.\"\n\nHathaway (18-2) had no reason to apologize after 15 minutes of domination that reminded everyone why he was once considered the U.K.'s greatest hope for a UFC champion. His return from competition after a harrowing battle with ulcerative colitis was a victory in and of itself. The fact that the 35-year-old looked as dominant as he did made it that much sweeter.\n\nThe story of the fight was the same for all three rounds: Hathaway took down Ricardo (11-6-2) and proceeded to pelt him with punches, elbows and hammerfists at his own pace. Hathaway looked completely comfortable doing it, too.\n\nAccording to the stats on the Oktagon 36 broadcast, Hathaway landed 116 significant strikes to Ricardo's two, and he took down his opponent seven times. Ricardo carried Hathaway's weight for practically the entire fight.\n\nIn the final 30 seconds of Round 2, Hathaway nearly got the finish. He managed to flatten out Ricardo onto his belly and rained punches on him. When Ricardo squirmed onto his back, Hathaway held the mount position and pounded him with an array of punches and hammerfists, but Ricardo was saved by the bell.","source":{"uri":"mmajunkie.usatoday.com","dataType":"news","title":"MMA Junkie"},"authors":[{"uri":"simon_samano@mmajunkie.usatoday.com","name":"Simon Samano","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2022/10/john-hathaway-andre-ricardo-oktagon-36.jpg?w=640","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.2862745098039217,"wgt":403558680,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226455370","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:36:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:36:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:09:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/DeSantis-to-continue-migrant-flights-to-17511637.php","title":"DeSantis to continue migrant flights to Democratic states","body":"Documents released Friday show that the two sets of planned flights will transport about 100 migrants to those two states.

Several Republicans who want to overturn the way votes are cast and counted are also running for top election administrator offices in their respective states.\n\nObama will tell voters that Democrats are the party for protecting abortion rights, but a main theme in his appearances will also be that Democrats can be better trusted to keep elections fair, with the next presidential contest set for 2024.\n\n\"He looks forward to stumping (rallying) for candidates up and down the ballot, especially in races and states that will have consequences for the administration of 2024 elections,\" Obama's office said in a statement.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a Republican, is also holding campaign events to support his party, with the rallies featuring speeches in which he has repeatedly hinted that he might run again for president in 2024.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that he lost the 2020 presidential contest to Democrat Joe Biden because of fraud.\n\nRepublicans who back Trump's false claim have become the party's nominees for top election officials in states that could play decisive roles in the 2024 contest.\n\nRepublicans Jim Marchant of Nevada and Mark Finchem of Arizona, for example, want to curtail or abolish early voting, mail-in voting and ballot drop-boxes, claiming that they breed fraud.\n\nVoting groups are concerned that the election of some far-right candidates could threaten the integrity of the next presidential election. There are claims that some might help Trump -if he decides to run again - or another like-minded Republican to overturn election results in 2024.\n\nIn an interview on the Pod Save America podcast released on Saturday, Obama said Democrats might not be able to trust that US courts will keep elections fair. That means Democrats must hold offices in closely-contested states to ensure the results of elections will be respected, he commented.\n\n\"Because it may turn out that in a close presidential election, at some point, certification of an election in a key swing-state may be at issue. And, it's going to be really important that we have people there who play it straight,\" said Obama.","source":{"uri":"sabcnews.com","dataType":"news","title":"SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

But now, \"a lot of that is broken down,\" he mentioned.\n\nThe former president attributed worsening communications between Russia and the U.S. to Russian President Vladimir Putin's rising isolation, each globally and inside his personal ranks.\n\n\"I think that we're now dealing with a type of Russian regime that is actually even more centralized, even more isolated and closed off,\" Obama mentioned. \"I think Putin has consolidated decision making to a degree that we haven't seen even during the Soviet era.\"\n\nUSA TODAY requested remark from the White House on Obama's remarks.\n\n- Ella Lee, USA TODAY\n\nRUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACKS:Death toll rises again as Russian missiles, drones hit Ukraine-held Zaporizhzhia\n\nThe U.S. will ship Ukraine a brand new $725 million bundle of weapons and navy help, the White House mentioned Friday.\n\nThe new bundle will embrace missiles, anti-tank weapons, ammunitions and medical provides, in accordance with a press release from the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIn whole, the U.S. has dedicated to greater than $18.2 billion in navy help to Ukraine since January 2021.\n\nThe European Union, in the meantime, is making ready to announce a few half billion extra euros of help to purchase weapons for Ukraine and a navy coaching mission in Europe for 1000's of Ukrainian troops, officers mentioned Friday.","source":{"uri":"pehalnews.in","dataType":"news","title":"Pehal News"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/10/14/USAT/17b174a0-b8c4-4740-ac18-1f1aad96954d-ukraine.png","eventUri":"zho-1301412","sentiment":-0.2627450980392156,"wgt":403558320,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226448884","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:28:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:28:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:13:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/john-hathaway-dominates-andre-ricardo-191313028.html","title":"John Hathaway dominates Andre Ricardo in long-awaited comeback fight at Oktagon 36","body":"For a guy who hadn't competed in an MMA fight since Barack Obama was President of the United States, John Hathaway looked like he didn't miss a beat.\n\nMaking his return to the cage after an eight-year absence, the former UFC standout put on a classic Hathaway performance, using his grappling, mat control and ground-and-pound to cruise to a unanimous decision over Andre Ricardo on Saturday at Oktagon 36 in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nThe judges scored the bout 30-26, 30-24, and 30-26 in favor of Hathaway, whose performance earned him his first win since UFC on Fuel TV 5 back in September 2012.\n\n\"It means a lot. It was a really good, enjoyable kind of fight,\" Hathaway said afterward. \"Obviously, everyone wishes they got the finish, but it was my first one out in eight years, so I kind of had to put the (work) in, go for the gears and figure out where I was. I'm sorry, everyone, I didn't get the finish. I tried my best, but obviously it's been a while.\"\n\nHathaway (18-2) had no reason to apologize after 15 minutes of domination that reminded everyone why he was once considered the U.K.'s greatest hope for a UFC champion. His return from competition after a harrowing battle with ulcerative colitis was a victory in and of itself. The fact that the 35-year-old looked as dominant as he did made it that much sweeter.\n\nThe story of the fight was the same for all three rounds: Hathaway took down Ricardo (11-6-2) and proceeded to pelt him with punches, elbows and hammerfists at his own pace. Hathaway looked completely comfortable doing it, too.\n\nAccording to the stats on the Oktagon 36 broadcast, Hathaway landed 116 significant strikes to Ricardo's two, and he took down his opponent seven times. Ricardo carried Hathaway's weight for practically the entire fight.\n\nIn the final 30 seconds of Round 2, Hathaway nearly got the finish. He managed to flatten out Ricardo onto his belly and rained punches on him. When Ricardo squirmed onto his back, Hathaway held the mount position and pounded him with an array of punches and hammerfists, but Ricardo was saved by the bell.","source":{"uri":"ca.sports.yahoo.com","dataType":"news","title":"Yahoo Sports"},"authors":[],"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2Otb93kGgxOfVlPJsyQOgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mma_junkie_usa_today_articles_344/bd15b3503262b23443fa887eb6164ebc","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.2862745098039217,"wgt":403558080,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226448886","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:28:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:28:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:09:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/desantis-continue-migrant-flights-democratic-190945649.html","title":"DeSantis to continue migrant flights to Democratic states","body":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

His ex-partner claims that she had to pursue him for the money.\n\nMr Walker has lied several times about the number of children he has, keeping campaign staff in the dark, and has repeated numerous false claims about his past, while facing allegations of domestic violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Pennsylvania Democratic candidate John Fetterman has raised more than $1m dollars after an NBC News interview in which he described the after-effects of the stroke he suffered earlier this year.\n\nThe interview has led to a major controversy thanks to subsequent remarks from the interviewer and other journalists about Mr Fetterman's cognitive abilities during the discussion.\n\nIt's unclear whether this debate will have changed any minds, but it could have solidified support for both candidates.\n\nMr Walker did better than expected, though the bar was low and he maintained that the abortion scandal dogging his campaign is a lie -- the issue was not addressed in depth.\n\nSenator Warnock gave thoughtful, rehearsed answers that seemed intended to appeal to the middle ground.\n\nUndoubtedly, the debate will only be remembered for Mr Walker pulling out a prop police badge, which was surreal.\n\n01:04 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nIn closing statements, Senator Warnock asks people to vote early (early voting begins in Georgia on Monday), while Mr Walker asks people to consider him -- the outsider -- as their representative in Washington. Throughout the debate he kept referring to Mr Warnock as a career politician or DC insider, though he has only held the job for two years.\n\n01:00 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nSenator Warnock also demurs to answer a question on whether he would expand the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Walker says he would not support increasing the number of justices.\n\n00:55 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nOn who should run in 2024, Senator Warnock manages to twice sidestep the issue of whether Joe Biden will be too old to run.\n\n\"I've not spent a minute thinking about what politicians should run in 2024.\"\n\n\"The people of Georgia hired me to represent them ... they didn't hire me to be a pundit.\"\n\nMr Walker says he would support Donald Trump: \"Yes, he's my friend.\"\n\n00:52 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThere is a question about how the US should react if Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons in Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nMr Walker responds by asking why Senator Warnock didn't stand up to Chuck Schumer.\n\n00:49 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThe moderators manage to keep the debate on track while both candidates try to respond to various allegations against them.\n\nOn the topic of healthcare, in a confusing answer Mr Walker appears to say that everyone has healthcare.\n\n\"Right now, people have coverage for health care.\"\n\nMr Walker says Georgians should \"get off the government healthcare and get on the healthccare he's got,\" pointing to Warnock.\n\n00:42 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nOn the question of character, Senator Warnock is asked about a dispute with his wife.\n\n\"I went through a divorce, like a lot of people, while that was a painful period... my children know I am with them and for them and that I support them in every single way that a father does.\"\n\n00:38 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nMoving on to crime, Mr Walker says Senator Warnock has \"empowered criminals to think they're more powerful than the police\".\n\nHe then lies and says 70 per cent of drugs coming over the border come to Atlanta.\n\n\"We will see time and time again tonight, as we've already seen, that my opponent has a problem with the truth,\" Senator Warnock says.\n\nThere are loud cheers from the crowd. There is then laughter when Mr Walker responds when accused of pretending to be a police officer by pulling out a police badge.\n\nOn a federal minimum wage, neither candidate is in favour of raising the federal minimum wage.\n\nMr Warnock clarifies that he wants a liveable wage, not a minimum wage.\n\nMr Walker says: \"This is not right, it's unfair. How can you transfer someone debt who owe it to someone who don't owe it? ... You gotta pay that debt\"\n\nSenator Warnock says: \"It's interesting that people crying about student debt haven't said anything against billion-dollar PPP loans.\"\n\n00:23 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nMr Warnock mentions that he has tried to tackle the issue of maternal mortality and has worked on the issue with Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n00:21 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nMr Walker continues: \"On abortion -- I'm a Christian. I believe in life... I'll be a senator that protects life.\"\n\nRev Warnock argues that on abortion the examination room is getting crowded and that he trusts \"women more than I trust politicians\" on the issue. So far tonight this get the biggest reaction from the audience.\n\n00:18 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nQuestioning turns to the abortion scandal that has plagued the Walker campaign. The Republican candidate denies that he paid his former girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\n\"I said that was a lie and I'm not backing down,\" he says.\n\n00:16 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThe second biggest concern of Georgia voters is threats to democracy and voting rights.\n\nMr Walker appears to reject Donald Trump's election fraud lies that the 2020 election was stolen: \"President Biden won and Senator Warnock won. That's the reason I decided to run.\"\n\nBoth candidates say they will respect the result in November.\n\n00:14 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThe first question in about the economy -- which polling says is the number one concern of the electorate -- Mr Walker immediately ties Mr Warnock to the Biden administration complaining about inflation and energy independence.\n\nMr Warnock mentions his work to lower the price of insulin and the Inflation Reduction Act. Mr Walker counters saying for insulin to work \"you gotta eat right\".\n\n00:09 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nSenator Warnock says he is pleased to be in his hometown of Savannah and that he grew up just a mile away.\n\n\"Only in America is my story possible,\" he says.\n\nMr Warnock's take on the race is that it is about who is ready to represent Georgia in the Senate.\n\n00:08 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nIn opening statements, Mr Walker says the race is not about him -- though much of the talk about the campaign has centered on the abortion scandal that has dogged him -- he says that the race is about what Mr Herschel and President Biden have done to Georgia families.\n\n00:04 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDemocrat Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker are facing off in Savannah, Georgia, tonight as the election day gets closer.\n\nRev Warnock is the first Black senator to represent the state and is asking voters to send him back to DC for a full six-year term.\n\nMr Walker has the support of former President Donald Trump and blames his opponent and President Joe Biden for the state's problems.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama is heading to Wisconsin to help boost Senate candidate Mandela Barnes, a Democrat challenging GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, two sources familiar with the plans told NBC News.\n\nThe former president is also expected to help boost Gov. Tony Evers' re-election efforts, the sources said.\n\nThe race between Shapiro and Mastriano may test how powerful that campaign spending is in one of the nation's highest-profile races for governor. One candidate has spent more money than any other gubernatorial nominee ever in Pennsylvania, and the other has spent less than any other in at least the past two decades.\n\nRead more:\n\nCampaign finance record broken in Pennsylvania governor race\n\n23:15 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDemocrats across Ohio are pleading for help in the state's Senate contest, afraid they may lose a winnable election unless national party leaders make major investments in the coming days.\n\nSo far, the most powerful groups in Democratic politics have prioritized Senate pickup opportunities in North Carolina, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania over Ohio, once a perennial swing state that veered right in the Trump era. But on the eve of the 2022 midterms, some public polls suggest Ohio is as competitive as the other swing states, leaving many Democrats here wondering why their party isn't backing Senate contender Tim Ryan more forcefully.\n\nRead more:\n\nOhio Dems press party to invest in high stakes Senate seat\n\n22:50 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nSenator Raphael Warnock and former University of Georgia running back Herschel Walker will square off in their only scheduled debate in Savannah on Friday.\n\nHere's what to watch for tonight:\n\nWhat to watch for in Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock Georgia senate debate\n\nThe 60-minute session, which will take place before a live audience, comes in the wake of reports that Walker paid for a girlfriend to have an abortion in 2009 before later fathering a child with her.

If Democrats don't agree to massive cuts in Medicare, Social Security, or other social programs, Republicans threaten to allow the U.S. to default on its credit by refusing to allow the debt ceiling to be raised. This action would unquestionably precipitate a catastrophic, global economic disaster, sending this nation and most of the developed (and undeveloped) world into a second and probably permanent Great Depression.\n\nFar more consequential than a \"government shutdown,\" this threat to arbitrarily default on the nation's existing debts has been wielded cynically and repeatedly since Republicans discovered its utility at energizing and inflaming their ignorant voter base against Democratic policies that benefit people they consider \"undeserving,\" (i.e., Black people and other racial minorities). The reality that it would inflict economic calamity to every person in this country, more or less across the board, is immaterial to them.\n\nTime and time again this tactic proved to be mere posturing: At the 11th hour, some agreement is suddenly reached, or resolution is suddenly passed, which keeps the U.S. government credit-worthy and assures other nations that yes, we will pay our already-incurred bills. As Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell himself acknowledged, the country's debt ceiling is a hostage that is worth ransoming, but probably not killing outright. After all, Republicans ultimately have to put food on their families' tables, too, and most of them prefer living in houses rather than on the streets. But now there's a big, big problem.\n\nAs political scientist and emeritus Norman Ornstein explains in an article written for The Atlantic, the current inhabitants of the Republican House of Representatives are more fanatic, ignorant, and blindly malevolent than even their Tea Party forebearers who pulled this nonsense on President Barack Obama (before they finally backed down) a decade ago. That was an act of intentional sabotage that -- even when mitigated at the last minute by the Obama administration reaching a deal with then-House Speaker John Boehner -- still resulted in the U.S. credit rating downgraded globally, costing the U.S. taxpayers billions in added borrowing costs and a dramatic plunge in the stock market.\n\nUnfortunately for the country, should this new and clueless breed of Republicans take control over the House in 2022, there is no leader among them respected enough to thwart their worst impulses, no matter how self-destructive. Assuming an unctuous political invertebrate like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy advances to the speakership, he will have next to no control over the actions of his caucus, and no capacity or authority to negotiate a resolution to such a crisis.\n\nAs Ornstein writes:\n\nIf there is one timeworn cliché about elections, it is that the next one is the most significant in our lifetime. There is reason to believe it is true this time. Although the outcomes remain uncertain, one thing is clear: If Republicans win control of the House of Representatives, the country will face a series of fundamental challenges much greater than we have had in any modern period of divided government, including a direct and palpable threat of default and government shutdown. The Republican majority will be more radical, reckless, and willing to employ nuclear options to achieve its goals than any of its predecessors have been, and its leadership, starting with McCarthy, will be either compliant or too weak to head off catastrophe.\n\nThis would effectively leave the fate of American people at the mercy of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and others of the House's bomb-throwing caucus, all of whom (as Ornstein notes) would be perfectly willing to march off the ledge and plunge the nation into a fiscal catastrophe, if only to solicit the ersatz applause of their thousands of Russian Twitter-bot followers. These people have already amply demonstrated they live in a hermetically sealed bubble of partisan rancor and fantasy that brooks no dissent, far less any inclination to fiscal reason. Through their warped, Trump-distorted goggles they would simply view this as an opportunity to permanently damage the Biden administration and earn the adulation of their equally nihilistic constituents.\n\nAs Tom Nichols, also writing for The Atlantic, aptly described the Republican MAGA base:\n\nThese citizens do not want a discussion or a compromise. They don't even want to \"win,\" in any traditional political sense of that word. They want to vent anger over their lives -- their personal problems, their haunted sense of inferiority, and their fears about social status -- on other Americans, as vehemently as possible, even to the point of violence. [...]\n\nThe MAGA movement isn't interested in politics, or policies, or compromises. It is interested in destruction and seeing others made as miserable as its followers are.\n\nFortunately, there is a way of dispensing with this farce and neutering the MAGA base's ability to inflict their ignorance and nihilism on the rest of us, one not involving dubious gimmicks such as the minting of a trillion-dollar coin to cover our nation's debts, or risking a constitutional crisis by President Joe Biden invoking the 14th Amendment to unilaterally suspend the debt ceiling. As Ornstein explains:\n\nIf the Republicans prevail in November, the lame-duck session becomes an opportunity to take this threat off the table once and for all. The way to do so is by making permanent, perhaps via reconciliation, the ironically named \"McConnell Rule.\" The rule was raised by the Senate Republican leader a decade ago to allow the president to raise the debt ceiling. It allows Congress to pass a joint resolution blocking the action, but contains a provision where the president is able to veto that resolution -- meaning, in this instance, that a president would need only one-third of support plus one of the two houses of Congress to avoid default.\n\nSince such a provision is quite literally tied to the budget it should pass muster with the parliamentarian for reconciliation in the lame-duck Congress, even in the event Republicans take control of the House. All Democrats -- even ones like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- would vote for it because their donors know what havoc a default would wreak on their own prospects, even if the MAGA base does not (Manchin has already expressed his support for such a procedure). House Republicans would scream and howl (and fundraise of course) about \"tyranny and \"executive overreach,\" but they're going to do that anyway.\n\nAs Ornstein observes, the stakes are just too high now to ignore the issue or hope it will somehow \"work out:\"\n\nWe have moved into a new and frightening era in American politics and governance, one when radicals intent on a revolution and craving major disruption will be not just a vocal minority but potentially dominating a governing body. We cannot risk the full consequences of that brutal reality.\n\nNo one can foresee the November election results. But the consequences of a Republican takeover of the House -- if it happens -- will be stark and visible soon enough to all Americans. In fact, Republicans have already made their intentions quite clear:\n\nDemocrats have no reason to accede to this kind of sabotage. It's time to put a stop to it, once and for all.\n\nDonate now to protect the Democratic majority in the House!\n\nThis is a Creative Commons article.

Russia then began what is believed to be its largest coordinated missile attacks in Ukraine since its invasion, killing dozens of people.\n\nOn Friday, Putin said Russia did not see the need for ongoing strikes but select ones would continue.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla, may be abandoning plans to ask the U.S. government to fund his Starlink satellite network in Ukraine after a Saturday tweet. USA TODAY has reached out to SpaceX for comment.\n\nIn the first weeks of the invasion in early March, Musk came to Ukraine's aid when his SpaceX company shared its Starlink satellite system that helps deliver internet access to areas that lack coverage.\n\nFriday, Musk, the world's richest man, tweeted that it cost SpaceX about $20 million a month to support the system and that the company \"cannot fund the existing system indefinitely.\"\n\n►A Russian missile strike seriously damaged a key energy facility in Ukraine's Kyiv region, Gov. Oleksiy Kuleba said Saturday, adding that there were no deaths or injuries. Repair crews are working to restore electricity but further outages are possible, the electricity transmission company Ukrenergo said.\n\n►Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he expects a controversial draft of army reservists he ordered to support its military campaign in Ukraine to be completed in two weeks, as Russia tries to counter gains by Ukrainian troops.\n\n►In the southern Ukraine region of Kherson, Moscow-installed authorities urged residents to evacuate to Russia on Friday as Ukrainian troops continued counteroffensive efforts into the region. The move appears to indicate that Ukrainian military gains are worrying Russia as it tries to hold onto areas illegally annexed from Ukraine last month.\n\n►Dane Partridge, a 34-year-old Idaho man serving as a volunteer soldier in Ukraine, died Tuesday from his injuries from a Russian attack in Luhansk in Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama sounded the alarm on increasingly tenuous communications between U.S. and Russian leadership in a Friday interview with the podcast Pod Save America.\n\n\"The thing that I'm most concerned about is that lines of communication between the White House and the Kremlin are probably as weak as they have been in a very long time,\" he told the podcast, which is hosted by former Obama administration staffers.\n\nDuring the Cold War, even at its most strained points, there was a sense that picking up the phone and communicating through diplomatic channels was still an option, Obama said. But now, \"a lot of that is broken down,\" he said.\n\nThe former president attributed worsening communications between Russia and the U.S. to Russian President Vladimir Putin's growing isolation, both globally and within his own ranks.\n\n\"I think that we're now dealing with a type of Russian regime that is actually even more centralized, even more isolated and closed off,\" Obama said. \"I think Putin has consolidated decision making to a degree that we haven't seen even during the Soviet era.\"\n\nUSA TODAY requested comment from the White House on Obama's remarks.\n\nThe U.S. will send Ukraine a new $725 million package of weapons and military aid, the White House said Friday.\n\nThe new package will include missiles, anti-tank weapons, ammunitions and medical supplies, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIn total, the U.S. has committed to more than $18.2 billion in military aid to Ukraine since January 2021.\n\nThe European Union, meanwhile, is preparing to announce about a half billion more euros of aid to buy weapons for Ukraine and a military training mission in Europe for thousands of Ukrainian troops, officials said Friday.","source":{"uri":"usatoday.com","dataType":"news","title":"USA Today"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/10/14/USAT/17b174a0-b8c4-4740-ac18-1f1aad96954d-ukraine.png?auto=webp&crop=1911,1075,x4,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","eventUri":"zho-1301412","sentiment":-0.2313725490196078,"wgt":403557480,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226443957","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:18:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:18:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:06:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-putin-russia-ukraine-war-power-soviet-union-cold-war-2022-10","title":"Obama says Putin has 'isolated' Russia and 'consolidated decision-making' to a greater extent than during the Soviet era","body":"By clicking 'Sign up', you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said on a recent podcast that he's \"concerned\" about the \"weak\" level of communication between the White House and Moscow in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the international fallout from the conflict.\n\nObama, who sought to forge diplomatic efforts with both Putin and ex-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev while in the White House, said during a newly-released episode of \"Pod Save America\" that even during the tumultuous Cold War -- which lasted from 1947 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 -- the two countries could speak on the phone and engage with each other.\n\n\"Lines of communication between the White House and the Kremlin are probably as weak as they have been in a very long time.

Ukraine has managed to withstand the Russian onslaught with the help of Western military aid, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regularly calls on the world to do more.

Even though Starlink is still losing money and other companies are getting billions of taxpayer dollars, we'll just keep funding the Ukraine government for free,\" Musk says on Twitter.\n\nOn Friday, Musk said SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine. The service has helped civilians and military stay online during the war. He made his remark after a media report that SpaceX had asked the Pentagon to pay for the donations of Starlink. The billionaire has been in online fights with Ukrainian officials over a peace plan he put forward which Ukraine says is too generous to Russia.\n\nSaturday, Oct. 15\n\n9:00 a.m. The U.S. Defense Department has received a request from SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk to take over funding for his satellite network, which has provided crucial battlefield communications for Ukrainian military forces since almost the beginning of its war with Russia, U.S. officials said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter not yet made public, told the Associated Press that the issue has been discussed in meetings and senior leaders are weighing the matter. There have been no decisions.\n\nIn a statement later Friday, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said, \"We can confirm the department received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of Starlink, their satellite communications product in Ukraine. We remain in communication with SpaceX about this and other topics.\"\n\n7:00 a.m. The Biden administration will send Ukraine a new $725 million package of weapons and other military assistance, the White House says. The announcement comes on the heels of meetings at NATO, where defense leaders from Europe and around the world pledged weapons and air defense systems to Ukraine as Russia intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other regions. Officials said there are no major new weapons in the U.S. package. Instead, the U.S. aid is largely aimed at restocking thousands of rounds of ammunition for the weapons systems Ukraine has been successfully using in its counteroffensive against Russia.\n\n1:45 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says that he sees no need for talks with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden and that no decision has been made on his own attendance at the Group of 20 summit in Indonesia, a potential venue for such a meeting.\n\nAsked at a news conference in Kazakhstan whether he is ready for talks with Biden, Putin says the same question should be put to the American leader.\n\nPutin also says he thinks Russia's mobilization of military reserves will be completed within about two weeks. About 222,000 people have been mobilized, he says, out of a target of 300,000.\n\nSeptember's partial mobilization order sent Russians fleeing across the border to escape a feared draft. Putin later said \"mistakes\" with the mobilization should be corrected and signed an amended order narrowing the scope of the call-up.\n\nFriday, Oct. 14\n\n6:00 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy marked Ukraine's Defenders Day holiday on Friday by promising victory over Russia and freedom for Ukraine. In a video address delivered somewhere in the hills outside the capital Kyiv, Zelenskyy thanked Ukraine's armed forces for defending their country. He said everything that had been taken away from Ukraine would be returned, and no soldier left in captivity.\n\n\"It seems that the current enemy in its evil unites all the enemies of our statehood that we faced before,\" he said. \"By defeating this enemy, we will respond to all enemies who encroached on Ukraine -- on those who lived, who live and who will live on our land. This will be a victory for all our people. This will be a victory for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\"\n\n3:30 p.m. Russian-backed forces have made tactical advances in the last three days toward the center of Bakhmut, a strategically important town in the eastern Donetsk region, and likely advanced into villages south of the town, the U.K. says. Bakhmut sits on a main road leading to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Private military company Wagner Group \"likely remains\" heavily involved in the Bakhmut fighting, Britain's Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence bulletin.\n\n12:00 p.m. Ukraine has liberated more than 600 settlements from Russian occupation in the past month, including 75 in the highly strategic Kherson region, Ukraine's Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories says. Some 502 settlements have been liberated in the northeast Kharkiv region where Ukrainian forces last month advanced deep into Russian lines, the ministry said, noting that 43 settlements were liberated in the Donetsk region and seven in the Luhansk region.\n\n8:00 a.m. Evacuees from Ukraine's southern Kherson region were expected to begin arriving in Russia on Friday after a Moscow-installed official suggested residents should leave for safety, a sign of Moscow's weakening hold on territory it claims to have annexed. \"We suggested that all residents of the Kherson region, if they wish, to protect themselves from the consequences of missile strikes ... go to other regions,\" Russian-installed Kherson administration chief Vladimir Saldo said in a video message. People should \"leave with their children.\"\n\n12:09 a.m. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi says he has raised with the Russian authorities the issue of a detained senior official at southeastern Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Valeriy Martyniuk's detention is unacceptable, Grossi says, speaking on a visit to Kyiv. Martyniuk is the plant's deputy director general for human resources.\n\nThursday, Oct. 13\n\n11:40 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin tells Asian leaders the Western-led financial system is trying to live at their expense.\n\n\"The world is becoming truly multi-polar,\" Putin says in a speech to the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in the Kazakh capital Astana. \"And Asia, where new centers of power are emerging, plays a significant, if not key, role in it.\"\n\n\"Like many of our partners in Asia, we believe a revision is needed of the global financial system, which has for decades allowed the self-proclaimed so-called 'golden billion', who redirected all capital flows and technologies to themselves to live largely at others' expense,\" Putin also says. Read more.\n\n6:30 p.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories is \"anti-Russian\" and that it had been achieved using \"diplomatic terror,\" TASS news agency reports. The United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly condemned Russia's move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine, calling on all countries not to recognize it.\n\n5:50 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that Ukraine has only about 10% of what it needs for its air defenses and rules out diplomatic contact with Russia. He said in a question-and-answer session with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Europe's leading human rights watchdog, that diplomacy was not possible with leaders who did not respect international law.\n\n2:30 p.m. Admitting Ukraine to NATO could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Alexander Venediktov, told the state TASS news agency in an interview. \"Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War III,\" TASS cited Venediktov as saying. \"Apparently, that's what they are counting on -- to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again.\"\n\n1:00 p.m. Critical infrastructure was hit by drone strikes early on Thursday, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Volodymyr Zelenskiy's presidential office says. \"Another attack by kamikaze drones on critical infrastructure facilities,\" Tymoshenko said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin has not commented.\n\n12:30 p.m. A settlement in the region of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, was hit by shelling early on Thursday, the region's administration said on the Telegram messaging app. \"Rescuers are already working at the site,\" the administration said, without providing further details on where the shelling took place.\n\n5:45 a.m. The U.N.

Read more.\n\n12:15 p.m. Japan will decide what to do about the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia's Far East in consultation with its partners as it reviews details of a decree by Moscow, Japanese industry minister Yasutoshi Nishimura says.\n\nRussia last week issued a decree allowing it to seize Exxon Mobil's 30% stake and gave a Russian state-run company the authority to decide whether foreign shareholders, including Japan's SODECO, can retain their participation in the project. \"The Sakhalin-1 remains an important project for Japan in terms of energy security,\" Nishimura said, adding that the project is a key energy source outside the Middle East, on which Japan relies for more than 95% of its oil supply.\n\n10:51 a.m. Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner says he has renounced his Russian citizenship.

It calls on the international community to support Japan's position.\n\nEfforts by Japan to negotiate their return had faltered even before Russia invaded Ukraine. Now, with Tokyo joining Western-led sanctions against Moscow, prospects for restarting talks on a peace treaty to formally end World War II look even more distant.\n\nThis marks Ukraine's latest expression of support for Japan on the Northern Territories. In 2020, Kyiv said the islands should be returned to Japan.\n\n1:25 a.m. Asked why U.S. President Joe Biden used the word \"Armageddon\" when referring to Russian nuclear threats, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says the U.S. had seen no reason to adjust its own nuclear posture and had no indications Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons.\n\nIn a press gaggle on board Air Force One, Jean-Pierre calls Russia's talk of using nuclear weapons \"irresponsible.\" She says Biden's comments were meant to reinforce how seriously the White House takes these threats.\n\n1:00 a.m. A Russian navy submarine along with a destroyer and a submarine rescue ship have been observed transiting the Soya Strait north of Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Defense's Joint Staff says.\n\nThe Kilo-class submarine and other ships passed from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Sea of Japan starting on Thursday, according to a Joint Staff news release.\n\nThe Soya Strait, also known as the La Perouse Strait, lies between the Japanese island of Hokkaido and Russia's Sakhalin.\n\n12:45 a.m. Ukrainian troops have reported outages of their Starlink communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX, the Financial Times reports, citing a senior Ukrainian official who called the loss of communication \"catastrophic.\"\n\n12:40 a.m. British diplomat Simon Manley sends a birthday message of sorts to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFriday, Oct. 7\n\n11:10 p.m. The U.S. has unveiled its new national strategy in the Arctic, warning of \"increasing strategic competition\" exacerbated by Russia and China and calling for greater cooperation among allies to \"uphold international law, rules, norms and standards\" in the region.\n\nThe strategy, which is an update of a 2013 document released by former President Barack Obama's administration, covers the U.S. agenda in the region over the next 10 years.\n\nThe document says that as an Arctic nation itself, the U.S. has the \"authority and responsibility\" to steward and protect the region.\n\n\"The United States seeks an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative,\" it says.

Grossi and Zelenskyy agreed to meet again after Grossi visits Russia.\n\n\"This is a particularly dangerous moment for the safety and security\" of the plant, Grossi says in the IAEA news release, referring to demands that workers there sign on with Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom. \"Staff at the plant are being forced to make a hugely difficult decision for themselves and their loved ones. The enormous pressure they are facing must stop.\"\n\nThe IAEA team at the plant has also reported shelling in an industrial area close to the access road.\n\n12:30 a.m. The head of the International Monetary Fund warns of a \"darkening\" global economic outlook for next year, blaming \"multiple shocks\" including the \"senseless\" war in Ukraine.\n\n\"We estimate that countries accounting for about one-third of the world economy will experience at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this or next year,\" Kristalina Georgieva says in a speech ahead of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. \"And, even when growth is positive, it will feel like a recession because of shrinking real incomes and rising prices.\"\n\nIn addition to the war, the IMF managing director also blames the COVID-19 pandemic and climate disasters for \"driving a global surge in prices, especially on food and energy, causing a cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\n\"Far from being transitory, inflation has become more persistent,\" Georgieva says. \"High energy and food prices, tighter financial conditions and lingering supply constraints decelerated growth.\"","source":{"uri":"asia.nikkei.com","dataType":"news","title":"Nikkei Asia"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F1%252F0%252F2%252F0%252F42640201-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1665806492AP22277374952757.jpg?width=1260&height=630&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms","eventUri":"eng-8092284","sentiment":-0.1843137254901961,"wgt":403557240,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226440399","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:13:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:13:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T19:10:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.8627451062202454,"url":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/2022/10/15/desantis-to-continue-migrant-flights-to-democratic-states","title":"DeSantis to continue migrant flights to Democratic states","body":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration plans to continue flying migrants who entered the country illegally to Democratic strongholds, his spokeswoman said Saturday, a day after newly released records showed the state paid nearly $1 million to arrange two sets of flights to Delaware and Illinois.\n\nDocuments released Friday show that the two sets of planned flights will transport about 100 migrants to those two states. They were scheduled to happen before Oct. 3 but apparently were halted or postponed. The contractor hired by Florida later extended the window for the trips until Dec. 1, according to memos released by the state Department of Transportation.\n\nWhen asked why they flights were postponed, DeSantis' communications director, Taryn Fenske, noted that Florida has been busy dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.\n\n\"While Florida has had all hands on deck responding to our catastrophic hurricane, the immigration relocation program remains active,\" Fenske said in an email Saturday.\n\nThe flights would be a follow-up to the Sept. 14 flights from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, that carried 49 mostly Venezuelan migrants to the island where former President Barack Obama owns a home. Local officials weren't told in advance that the migrants were coming.\n\nDeSantis claimed responsibility for the flights as part of a campaign to focus attention on what he has called the Biden administration's failed border policies. He was joining Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in the tactic of sending migrants to Democratic strongholds without advance warning.\n\nEarlier this year, the Florida Legislature approved a $12 million budget item to relocate people in the country illegally from Florida to another location.

What this means for India - ExBulletin","body":"Pakistani Army Chief of Staff General Qamar Jawed Bajwa is expected to step down in just over a month. But just before his retirement, he managed to bring back several trophies for Pakistan from the United States of America. The almighty general not only managed to secure a $450 million global deal to revive the combat potential of the Pakistan Air Force's F-16 fighter fleet, he also managed to bring the United States to do something about Pakistani-occupied Kashmir that no leader has been able to since the country's inception. During his three-day official visit to Muzaffarabad earlier this month, US Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome referred to the POK as \"Azad Kashmir\". This will allow Pakistan to qualify the region as a sovereign territory of Pakistan.\n\nGeneral Bajwa could also take credit for effectively advocating Pakistan's case to senior US leaders to remove it from the gray list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a terrorist finance watchdog, after four years. Although terrorist groups still roam freely in the country, Pakistan has been deemed \"compliant\" with the action plan set out by the FATF, which meets in Paris from October 18-21.\n\nGen Bajwa, who is due to retire on November 29, seems like a man in a hurry. Given the unstable political atmosphere in the country, there is speculation in strategic circles about his true intention - whether he will gracefully step down from Rawalpindi or seek a leadership or mentoring role in the military-political establishment. in Pakistan ? The way he manipulated his position as army chief and convinced the Americans to recognize him as Pakistan's de facto ruler surprised many. Bajwa was personally received by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin outside the Pentagon during his last visit to Washington.\n\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of U.S.-Pakistan relations. I had the pleasure of welcoming the Pakistani Army Chief of Staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, to the Pentagon, where we discussed our longstanding defense partnership and areas of mutual interest. . pic.twitter.com/ptiZDiqc8I\n\n-- Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III (@SecDef) October 5, 2022\n\nLooking ahead: [email protected]\n\nClearly, Bajwa has succeeded in bringing Pakistan back into the American fold. After the release of Imran Khan from the post of Prime Minister, who very often alleges at public rallies that he was ousted from power at the request of the \"American masters of General Bajwa\", the Pakistani strongman was able to achieve for his country what the previous Democratic leaders or generals have not been able to do. Bajwa, who made several visits to Washington after the impeachment of Imran Khan's government, was also able to provide a very generous flood relief aid of US$66 million.\n\nAfter the departure of Imran, who had forged deep ties with Russia, the new coalition government led by Shahbaz Sharif, more favorable to the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, opened its doors to America. In fact, the Pakistani military is said to have been instrumental in helping the United States remove al-Qaeda leader Ayman-al-Jawahiri from a safe hiding place in Kabul.\n\nFaced with economic and political instability, Pakistan is in dire straits, with the recent devastating floods only adding to the woes of a nation barely struggling to survive due to the crisis of foreign exchange and an economy endangered. Pakistan, which somehow managed to secure a $1.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, can hope to manage its spending on essentials like petrol and gas, the prices of which have soared. In this difficult situation, Pakistan seeks help not only from its friends but also from India. However, US flood aid will go a long way in reducing any anti-US sentiment among ordinary Pakistani masses.\n\nREAD ALSO | US-Pak F-16 deal, Ukraine's position in India: two irritants in India-US relations and issues raised\n\nWhat the US U-turn on Pakistan and Kashmir means for India\n\nOn January 1, 2018, then-US President Donald Trump tweeted: \"The US foolishly gave Pakistan over $33 billion in aid over the past 15 years, and they didn't give us given only lies and deceptions, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give refuge to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\"\n\nThe Trump administration had stopped all military aid to Pakistan, even though US forces were still in Afghanistan and needed Pakistani support to maintain the huge military presence in the war-torn country.\n\nEarlier, during the administration of Barack Obama, then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that Pakistan was raising snakes in her backyard.\n\nThe US administration's recent U-turn on Pakistan and Kashmir has therefore puzzled Indian strategic observers. India took this seriously and registered its protest.\n\nWhile the United States also portrays Pakistan as a significant contributor in the fight against terrorism, thereby promoting the Islamabad narrative that Pakistan is itself a victim of terrorism and should be removed from the FATF gray list , it is feared that this will encourage Pakistan based terrorist groups to reorganize, come out in the open and launch attacks against India with impunity, forcing India to divert more of its resources to fight the threat increased.\n\nIn the past, whenever Pakistan received military aid from the United States, India faced increased military pressure on its borders.\n\nBecause India is also an important and essential member of the QUAD, the Indo-Pacific grouping of four nations whose primary objective is to reduce Chinese domination. And China will gain if India diverts China's attention to Pakistan.\n\nThe United States embracing an important loyal ally of China and strengthening its military capabilities will in fact strengthen China, which has already developed access to the Arabian Sea through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, via the Kashghar-Gwadar highway. .\n\nIn fact, a militarily strengthened Pakistan could prove to be an asset for China to counter the QUAD agenda. The Trump administration realized this by stopping all military aid to Pakistan.\n\nThe current coalition government led by Shahbaz Sharif is a temporary regime and does not seem to have the slightest political will to take a firm stand against terrorist groups. This is evident from the way the Pakistani government has blocked all attempts by the United Nations Security Council, with the help of its lifelong friend China, to include the names of some of the feared terrorists fed by the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI in the UN Sanctions List under the 1267 committee. Interestingly, the United States was previously at the forefront of proposals to ban Pakistan-based terrorists. The United States had also supported the FATF resolution to keep Pakistan on the gray list for failing to take sufficient steps to take appropriate action against terrorists and their organizations. Observers wonder what the US administration will gain from this sudden embrace of a country that is often described as a failed state and internationally known for producing terrorists.\n\nThis bowing to the Pakistani general will only encourage the Pakistani military establishment to become more aggressive against India, thus fueling tensions in the region. This will not only deepen a trust deficit in India-US bilateral relations, but will also create turmoil in the Indo-Pacific region where India and the United States, as well as Australia and Japan, have pledged to ensure peace, security and stability.\n\nThe author is a strategic business analyst.\n\n[Disclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal.]\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online","source":{"uri":"exbulletin.com","dataType":"news","title":"ExBulletin"},"authors":[],"image":"https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2022/10/15/f5419405b2ca4642a0aee5f01463e26b1665838392326236_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=1200&imheight=628","eventUri":"eng-8101300","sentiment":0.1843137254901961,"wgt":403556640,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226434226","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"19:04:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T19:04:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T18:52:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5411764979362488,"url":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/putin-says-no-more-massive-153111602.html","title":"Putin says 'no need' for more massive strikes; Obama says lack of communication with Kremlin is concerning: Updates","body":"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday there was \"no need for massive strikes\" now after a barrage of missile attacks in Ukraine.\n\nThe strikes followed a bombing that damaged the bridge linking Russia to the Crimean Peninsula a week ago.

But it's worth taking a step back to consider what President Joe Biden's move on marijuana policy tells us about how democracy actually works.\n\nNo automatic mechanism converts public opinion into public policy. And even when opinion is reflected in policy, change tends to occur incrementally.\n\nThat's certainly been the case for marijuana. Very marginal steps toward legalization took place state by state working up to national policy change -- though Biden's pardons of people convicted of possession still falls far short of where the public is on this issue. One survey finds a solid 69% of Americans in favor of legalization.\n\nWhy does policy tend to lag behind public opinion? For one, it usually takes organized groups, especially those aligned with political parties, to bring about significant change. But advocacy for marijuana liberalization has been driven, by and large, by individuals.\n\nPeople are also reading...

What to know. Howard, River Queens sour Muskies' senior night Gov. Kim Reynolds visits Muscatine Muskies outlast Blue Devils in MAC finale\n\nProponents of liberalization won enough support from groups aligned with the Democratic Party that decriminalization and other steps were included in their 2020 platform. Presidents and their parties tend to at least try to keep their campaign promises. That's what Biden is doing. They often fall short, as Biden has done on voting rights, because they don't have the votes in Congress or otherwise can't make things happen. But they do usually try.\n\nBiden also is moving cautiously because presidential action entails real risks -- for Biden, but also for the policy Democrats want. Presidential involvement on any issue tends to polarize public opinion. Because Democrats are already almost all in favor of legalization, nothing can be gained on that side.\n\nAt the same time, Republican voters who now support marijuana legalization may flip to opposing it once it's identified with a Democratic president. Opposing the president is such a strong impulse that it even has led to a surprising amount of Republican support for Russia and opposition to Ukraine in the current conflict.\n\nThis is also a tricky area to navigate for prominent Republicans. Normally, it's safe for them to simply oppose whatever Biden supports. But in this case, Biden is endorsing something already very popular, including among many Republican voters. As the midterms approach, Republicans could find their vocal opposition to Biden in general undermined by voter support for Biden's move on marijuana.\n\nThe current situation isn't unlike what happened with former President Barack Obama and marriage equality. The right to same-sex marriage was gaining in popularity, especially among Democrats, yet Obama feared the political consequences of moving ahead, and also had less ability to effect policy change.\n\nIt's doubtful that marijuana will make much difference in this fall's midterms. The issue unites Democrats (by a margin of 86% to 7% in a recent poll conducted by Civiqs, a public opinion firm) while splitting Republicans down the middle (45% to 43%), so there might be some room for Democrats to grab some Republican votes. But only so many people are open to flipping their planned vote at this point, and of those only a very limited number tell pollsters that marijuana policy is a high priority.\n\nIt was smart of Biden to wait for public opinion, rather than to try to lead it. The question now will be whether support for legal weed has become strong enough that presidential involvement will no longer matter.

The Atlantic recently called her \"Trumpism's leading lady.\" She has largely overshadowed Hobbs, whose more subdued personality has driven far fewer headlines.\n\nThe immediate object of Democratic hand-wringing this week is a decision by Hobbs, who has served as Arizona's secretary of state since 2019, to decline to debate Lake. Instead, she arranged a one-on-one interview with a local PBS affiliate, a move that prompted the Citizens Clean Elections Commission, a group established by a ballot initiative in 1998, to cancel its planned Q&A with Lake.\n\nThomas Collins, executive director of the commission, said in an interview that the Hobbs campaign had never seriously negotiated over the format of a debate -- and that, in any case, the organization was neither willing nor able to accommodate what officials there viewed as an \"ultimatum\" from the secretary of state's team about policing the \"content\" of the event.\n\nHe shared an exchange of letters and emails between the commission and Nicole DeMont, Hobbs' campaign manager, who wrote in an email that Hobbs was \"willing and eager to participate in a town-hall-style event\" but would not join a debate that \"would only lead to constant interruptions, pointless distractions and childish name-calling.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Lake repeated her challenge to debate Hobbs and accused Arizona PBS, which did not respond to a request for comment, of cutting \"a backroom deal with that coward to give her airtime that she does not deserve.\"\n\nDays earlier, Lake tried to ambush Hobbs during a town hall event at which the candidates made separate appearances onstage -- a stunt that was clearly intended to embarrass the Democrat.\n\nHobbs has said she was simply reacting to the way Lake conducted herself during a Republican primary debate in June, in which she dodged questions and repeated falsehoods about what happened in 2020. \"I have no desire to be a part of the spectacle that she's looking to create, because that doesn't do any service to the voters,\" Hobbs said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nAmong those second-guessing Hobbs' decision this week was Sandra Kennedy, a co-chair of President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign in Arizona. \"If I were the candidate for governor, I would debate, and I would want the people of Arizona to know what my platform is,\" Kennedy told NBC News.\n\nLaurie Roberts, a liberal columnist for The Arizona Republic, published a scathing column on Hobbs this week in which she wrote that the Democratic nominee's refusal to debate Lake \"represents a new level of political malpractice.\"\n\nAnd David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, criticized Hobbs on his podcast for what he said was a \"mistake\" in avoiding debates with Lake. He added, \"I think it's a recognition that Kari Lake is a formidable media personality.\"\n\nDemocrats have also noted that when Hobbs appeared on \"Face the Nation\" -- directly after Lake gave an interview to Major Garrett of CBS News -- she spent much of the eight-minute interview on the defensive rather than prosecuting a political argument against her opponent. Democrats called it a missed opportunity to highlight's Lake's slippery answers about the 2020 election.\n\nOne reason for the fraying nerves among Democrats is their widely shared view that the stakes of the governor's race in Arizona are existential for the party. Democrats fear that Lake, if elected, would conspire to tilt the state back into the Republican column during the 2024 presidential election and help usher Trump back into power. Her charisma and on-camera skills make her uniquely dangerous, they say.\n\nHobbs Allies Push Back\n\nPrivately, while Democrats acknowledge that anxiety about the governor's race is running high, they insist that Hobbs is running about as well as any Democrat could.\n\nThey note that the contest is essentially tied in polls even though Arizona is a purple state with a deep reservoir of conservative voting habits. The current Republican governor, Doug Ducey, won reelection by more than 14 percentage points in 2018. (Ducey is stepping down because of term limits.) And they say that Hobbs, unlike Lake, is aiming her pitch primarily at swing voters rather than at her party's base.\n\nAccording to the Cook Political Report's Partisan Voter Index, which measures the past performance of states and congressional districts across the country, Republicans have a built-in advantage in Arizona of 2 percentage points.\n\nSome Democrats say Hobbs has failed to campaign vigorously enough, in contrast to the seemingly omnipresent Lake. Allies of Hobbs defend her by noting she has been bopping around the state, but in something of an acknowledgment that she could do more, they say she is planning a third statewide tour as Arizona's scorching heat dissipates this fall.\n\n\"Katie Hobbs has been running an incredibly strong campaign, and the fact that this race is so competitive speaks to that,\" said Christina Amestoy, a communications aide at the Democratic Governors Association, who dismissed the concerns as \"angst from the chattering class.\"\n\nAmestoy noted that Hobbs was drawing support from independents and Republicans as well as from partisan Democrats -- a recognition, she said, that voters want \"substance\" over \"conspiracy theories.\"\n\nWith the help of the governors group, which has transferred $7 million to the Arizona Democratic Party, Hobbs has spent more than $10 million on television ads since Labor Day. She has leaned heavily on two themes: her support for law enforcement, and a portrayal of Lake as an extremist on abortion.\n\nSeveral Hobbs ads show Chris Nanos, the grizzled sheriff of Pima County, in uniform. Nanos warns in one spot that Arizona law enforcement officers could be required to arrest doctors and nurses who perform abortions if Lake becomes governor. He says such a move would divert resources from fighting crime and illegal immigration.\n\nOther ads introducing Hobbs to voters have depicted her as a down-to-earth former social worker who drove for Uber as a state lawmaker to help make ends meet, an implied contrast to Lake, whose career as a newscaster made her moderately wealthy.\n\nThe State of Play\n\nDemocrats are counting on appealing to crossover voters in the suburbs, as they did when Biden won the state in 2020. They have highlighted Lake's comments ripping Republicans who have criticized her as \"a cavalcade of losers\" and depicted her attempts to distance herself from previous hard-line remarks on abortion as duplicitous.\n\nHobbs might benefit, too, from the strength of Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat who is polling comfortably ahead of Blake Masters, the Republican challenger in Arizona's Senate race.\n\nDemocrats in Arizona are running a coordinated statewide campaign that allows them, in theory, to reap economies of scale, target their spending and avoid duplicative efforts on traditional campaign activities like door-knocking and turnout operations.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans in the state are in the midst of a power struggle between the fading establishment wing of the party, led by Ducey, and the emerging Trump-backed wing, spearheaded by Lake and Mark Finchem, the party's nominee for secretary of state.\n\nIn one small illustration of the infighting on the right, the Republican Governors Association has begun funneling its advertising money through the Yuma County Republican Party rather than the official state party, an unusual arrangement that speaks to the level of mutual mistrust between national Republican leaders and Kelli Ward, the chair of the state Republican Party.\n\nThat has given Democrats slightly more bang for their advertising dollar, because Republicans were paying higher rates before they made the shift to the Yuma County Republican Party.\n\nRepublicans, projecting increased confidence in Lake's eventual victory, reveled in the Democratic shirt-rending over Hobbs -- a welcome diversion, perhaps, from their own internal squabbles.\n\n\"In a state where problems with illegal immigration and the economy are top of mind, Democrats were always going to be at a disadvantage because voters don't believe their party can adequately fix the issues,\" said Jesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the RGA. \"What Democrats couldn't plan for was Katie Hobbs' self-immolation in front of a national audience.\"","source":{"uri":"news.yahoo.com","dataType":"news","title":"Yahoo News"},"authors":[],"image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4Ko_DOO5G4TocjaOHaJRWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/daa8976e7f6256dc26a1a1aca81bbadc","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.05882352941176472,"wgt":403555680,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226423210","lang":"spa","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"18:47:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T18:47:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T18:47:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.545098066329956,"url":"https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-10-15/xi-jinping-biografia-china-poder-perfil_3035596/","title":"El mito de Xi: la vida de mil espejos del hombre más poderoso del mundo","body":"Les vamos a presentar al hombre más poderoso del mundo*. Dentro vídeo institucional:\n\nFaltan pocos minutos para las cuatro de la tarde y una nutrida comitiva de coches oficiales aparca frente a la modesta hacienda cafetalera de Tulio Zamora y Ruth Calvo en Santo Domingo de Heredia, una localidad costarricense aledaña a la capital San José. La familia ha preparado café caturra, empanada de chiverre, picadillo de arracache y bizcochos para sus distinguidos invitados, el presidente Xi Jinping y su esposa, Peng Liyuan.\n\nEs junio de 2013 y hace apenas tres meses que Xi ha sido nombrado presidente de la República Popular China. Llega a casa de los Zamora vestido con pantalones negros y una sencilla camisa blanca, sin chaqueta ni corbata. En su fugaz visita, la sonriente pareja presidencial estrechará manos, abrazará niños y compartirá dulces. Todo perfectamente coreografiado y registrado para su posterior edición y difusión por la gigantesca red estatal de medios chinos.\n\n\"Yo también soy del pueblo llano. Fui agricultor siete años, luego me convertí en alcalde de un pueblo, de un distrito, de una ciudad y gobernador de una provincia -- explica el líder asiático sentado a la mesa con sus anfitriones a través de un intérprete -- . Pero tengo un vínculo natural con la gente común\".\n\nDe la larga lista de anécdotas, datos o imágenes que podrían servir para introducir la figura de Xi, esta insólita merienda costarricense es la que mejor resume la idea central de este perfil. Una escena que refleja la vida de mil espejos del líder chino, cuya biografía ha quedado fundida y confundida con la propaganda comunista hasta el más mínimo detalle con un único objetivo: crear un mito a la altura de la ambición de un hombre cuyas decisiones -- y no exageramos aquí -- marcarán al mundo durante generaciones.\n\nPorque, ¿qué sabemos en realidad de Xi Jinping? Si le interesa la vida de los políticos internacionales, no tendrá problemas en conocer los detalles más oscuros, polémicos o sensibles del pasado de Vladímir Putin, Angela Merkel o Donald Trump, sujetos al escrutinio de un sinfín de libros, biografías y documentales. Pero el líder chino ha permanecido ajeno a este fenómeno editorial que produce la fascinación del poder. Las contadas semblanzas disponibles son las que nos llegan enmascaradas en el brochazo gordo de la propaganda o distorsionadas por la crítica furibunda.\n\n\"Una razón por la que no hay una buena biografía de Xi Jinping es por el gigantesco coste personal\", explicó una vez Mike Forsythe, uno de los corresponsales del 'New York Times' en China. \"El Partido Comunista Chino guarda con mucho celo la historia oficial. Y el intento de hacer una investigación dentro del país sobre su juventud o su década en Fujian es peligroso para ti, para cualquiera con el que trabajes y para cualquiera con el que hables\".\n\nCualquier perfil será, entonces, un retrato forzosamente incompleto de la vida de Xi. Todos los periodistas repetimos las mismas citas del líder sacadas de las mismas entrevistas, recopilamos las mismas anécdotas y los mismos testimonios cuidadosamente filtrados que, como migas de pan, ha dejado la censura para asegurarse una versión monolítica y sin fisuras del relato. Sus refinados gustos literarios de lector empedernido, su afición a 'blockbusters' de Hollywood como 'El Padrino', su ecléctica filosofía de budismo tibetano y ocultismo chino. Todo, fuegos de artificio que no nos sirven para escrutar a un hombre que tiene autoridad absoluta sobre políticos, militares, empresarios, periodistas y jueces de la mayor potencia demográfica del planeta.\n\nPero, irónicamente, quizás esa sea la mejor pista que tengamos para entender hacia dónde se dirige Xi, la que nos presenta el propio relato oficial. Porque, en esa obstinada deconstrucción de la realidad, el Partido Comunista Chino (PCCh) ha dejado entrever sus obsesiones y sus debilidades, sus miedos para el presente y sus grandilocuentes planes de futuro. De forma instintiva o deliberada, la propaganda china está siguiendo el arquetipo 'del viaje del héroe', analizado por Joseph Campbell en su clásico 'El héroe de las mil caras' (1949). Un arco narrativo en el que el protagonista va completando sucesivas etapas para transformarse, progresivamente, en un 'mito'.\n\nEn el caso de Xi, la leyenda traza el camino de un príncipe caído en desgracia que, desde una remota aldea, irá ascendiendo en hasta convertirse, medio siglo después, en 'el elegido'. El único que puede vencer al gran archienemigo y cumplir, por fin, la gran profecía geopolítica: el renacer de China y el ocaso de Occidente. Esta sublimación desde la pobreza, la humillación y la servidumbre hacia la riqueza, la gloria y el poder calza a la perfección con la mística y evolución del pueblo chino en los últimos 70 años. Una forma nada sutil de dejarnos claro que Xi es China. O \"los brazos, las piernas y el corazón de toda la nación\", como le gusta decir con su habitual pompa al aparato.\n\n\"Xi Jinping, nos cuenta la propaganda, es un hombre que, al contrario que la élite china, ha experimentado la crudeza de la vida en su máxima expresión\", explica Kerry Brown, sinólogo y autor de '', en una entrevista con El Confidencial. \"Y ese sufrimiento compartido con el pueblo es esencial para tener la legitimidad de emprender el 'gran rejuvenecimiento' de China: liderar un país que sufrió injusticias por parte de Occidente durante décadas y ahora quiere convertirse en una superpotencia a la que nadie le haga 'bullying'\".\n\nPero entonces, ¿qué hace el futuro hombre más poderoso del mundo tomando un cafecito en el porche de la casa del señor Tulio, a 15.000 kilómetros de su país?\n\nEs la primera gira internacional de Xi en el cargo, cuyo destino final es estrechar la mano de Barack Obama en la Casa Blanca. Pero con esta breve parada, aparentemente irrelevante, está mandando un mensaje clave para esta historia. Varios, en realidad. El primero, a su público en casa. Uno que no para de repetir y que viene a decir: yo vengo de abajo, soy uno de vosotros, yo os entiendo. Y el segundo, a quien quiera que pueda estar escuchando: el mito de Xi será global.\n\nEl Confidencial ha entrevistado a una docena de biógrafos, economistas, políticos y periodistas que han estudiado la vida y obra del líder asiático para comprender cómo, paso a paso, se ha forjado su mito de Xi Jinping, al que un exministro español que tuvo trato con él definió como \"una caja negra indescifrable\". Entender en qué punto de la fábula está el personaje nos permitirá vislumbrar los capítulos finales de esta historia. Una historia que nos atañe a todos.\n\nXi Jinping se educó entre algodones. Tercero de cuatro hermanos, nació en 1953 en una familia de la élite. Su padre, Xi Zhongxun -- héroe de la Revolución del 49 -- era ministro de Propaganda de Mao Zedong y poco después sirvió como vice primer ministro. Estos cargos permitían que el niño Xi perteneciera al selecto club de 'los pequeños príncipes' que correteaban por los pasillos de Zhongnanhai, la Casa Blanca china, y estudiaban en el '1 de Agosto', el exclusivo colegio reservado para la dirigencia comunista. Estaban destinados a ser los futuros líderes del Partido y la nación. Pero pronto las cosas comenzaron a torcerse para los Xi.\n\nEl 'viaje del héroe' o 'the quest' comienza cuando la vida apacible y familiar del protagonista se ve subvertida por un evento inesperado que lo forzará a emprender una búsqueda épica, en la que sufrirá la soledad, enfrentará infinitas dificultades y estará a punto de morir varias veces antes de vencer.\n\nA principios de los sesenta, la familia de Xi cayó en desgracia por desavenencias políticas. Su padre fue desterrado a trabajar a una fábrica y su madre, enviada a trabajos forzados en una granja. Las cosas empeoraron el 26 de diciembre de 1966, cuando Mao Zedong celebró su 73 cumpleaños con una consigna: \"¡Por el nacimiento de una guerra civil por todo el país!\". Era el comienzo oficial de la desastrosa Revolución Cultural, que dejó al país con millones de muertos, decenas de millones de desplazados y una economía arrasada.\n\nEl propio dictador había firmado una directiva que instigaba al pueblo a atacar a los representantes de la burguesía, entre los que se encontraba su familia. Nacer 'rojo' dejó de ser el pasaporte hacia la buena vida y se convirtió en un lastre social. Con apenas 13 años, la vida de Xi corría peligro en Pekín, donde la situación se había vuelto insostenible. Declarado enemigo del pueblo de la noche a la mañana, tuvo que aprender la única habilidad que no le habían enseñado en su escuela de lujo: sobrevivir.\n\n\"Para entender quién es Xi Jinping hay que comprender esta increíble fuerza de alguien que conoció lo mejor y después cayó a los infiernos\", explica François Bougon, corresponsal durante años en China y autor del libro '', a El Confidencial. \"Aquella generación de jóvenes que fue obligada a huir hacia el campo aprendió a vivir como lobos solitarios. Y Xi Jinping es como un lobo: tiene fe ciega en el comunismo, pero sabe que cualquier persona le puede traicionar y que, de un día para otro, lo puedes perder todo\".\n\n\"Tiene fe ciega en el comunismo, pero sabe que cualquier persona le puede traicionar y que, de un día para otro, lo puedes perder todo\"\n\nEn las pocas entrevistas que ha dado a lo largo de los años, el líder chino recuerda una época de caos, terror y mucha incertidumbre. Un colapso 'distópico' que le marcó de por vida. Sin clases a las que asistir, se dedicaba a robar libros de las bibliotecas o a recoger los que tiraban otros a la basura por miedo a que los acusaran de \"enemigos del pueblo\". Hasta en cuatro ocasiones le detuvieron los Guardias Rojos y le amenazaron con matarle. Una vez, recordaba el propio Xi en el año 2000, le preguntaron si creía que sus crímenes eran graves.\n\n\"¿Tan graves como para merecer que me disparéis?\", cuenta que les respondió él. \"Ellos me dijeron que iba a ser fusilado 100 veces, y yo pensé: ¿Cuál es la diferencia entre que te fusilen una y 100 veces? Es lo mismo. Los Guardias Rojos querían meterme miedo diciéndome que ahora iba a sentir lo que era una dictadura democrática del pueblo y que solo me quedaban cinco minutos de vida. Pero al final me dijeron que me pusiera a leer frases de Mao todas las noches\".\n\nEn 1969, con apenas 15 años, Xi Jinping fue enviado con otros 15 adolescentes a Liangjiahe, un pueblo remoto a las afueras de Yan'an, en la provincia agrícola de Shaanxi, -- conocida como la \"tierra santa de la Revolución China\" -- . Era parte del masivo plan de Mao para endurecer y 'reeducar' a los acomodados jóvenes urbanos. Cuando se subió al tren, contó más adelante, todos sus compañeros lloraban menos él, que sonreía. Sabía que irse de la capital significaba seguir con vida.\n\nAllí, entre colinas alfombradas de bosques y escarpados picos amarillos, Xi vivió siete años, tres de ellos en una cueva. Sus inicios fueron duros. Él mismo reconoció que era tan incompetente que otros trabajadores le pusieron un seis sobre 10, \"ni siquiera igual de alto que las mujeres\". \"La intensidad del trabajo me estremeció\". Para escaquearse empezó a fumar, porque \"nadie molesta a un hombre fumando\". Después de tres meses, intentó escapar a Pekín, pero fue arrestado y trasladado de nuevo al pueblo, según relató en un ensayo de 1998 titulado 'Hijo de la Tierra Amarilla'. Entonces, llegó la epifanía.\n\n\"Los cuchillos se afilan en la piedra. La gente se modela a través de las dificultades\"\n\nSiguiendo el formato hagiográfico del mito, nos encontramos aquí con la habitual reticencia al cambio del personaje y cómo la figura de un mentor le da la inspiración necesaria para aceptar su destino. El maestro, convenientemente para la leyenda de Xi, será el propio pueblo chino. La gente humilde del campo. \"Yan'an es el punto de inicio de mi vida\", dijo en 2007 recordando sus años rurales. \"La mayoría de las ideas fundamentales y las cualidades que tengo hoy fueron adquiridas en Yan'an\".\n\nTestimonios de personas del lugar recogidos en algunas crónicas describen a un niño de ciudad perdido, que llegó al pueblo con una pesada maleta llena de libros y que no se entendía con los locales por el acento. En Liangjiahe, Xi Jinping se convirtió en jornalero, acarreando estiércol y reparando caminos rurales. Dormía en una cama de ladrillos cubierta de una fina colcha; comía y cenaba gachas y su inodoro era un balde. Pasó de ser un delicado y tímido adolescente a un joven estajanovista, cavando zanjas con los pantalones atados con una cuerda por la mañana y leyendo obras marxistas a la luz del quinqué por las noches.\n\n\"Mientras él leía, yo liaba cigarrillos. Leía la Selección de Obras de Mao Zedong, citas famosas de Mao y el periódico. No había nada más\", recordó Lü Housheng, uno de los compañeros de Xi en la cueva, a la BBC en una entrevista en 2015, en la que describió a Xi como un joven sin sentido del humor, que no jugaba a las cartas ni quería buscar novia ni salir de fiesta.\n\n\"Los cuchillos se afilan en la piedra. La gente se modela a través de las dificultades\", explicó el propio Xi en su entrevista más extensa que dio en 2000. \"Ahora, cada vez que me enfrento a un problema, tan solo pienso cómo de difíciles eran las cosas antes y que nada podría ser tan complicado ahora\", resumió sobre cómo esos años forjaron su carácter y cimentaron su fe en el comunismo.\n\nEn poco tiempo, Xi Jinping se convirtió en un pequeño ídolo local. Si había una pelea, un conflicto o un problema, la comunidad le pedía consejo. \"Ven en dos días\", les decía Xi. Y cuando volvían, el problema estaba solucionado, relataba Lu Nengzhong, el patriarca de una casa-cueva donde Xi vivió varios años, a 'The New York Times'. También cuenta que hizo experimentos con estiércol de cerdo para lograr biogás y que muchas casas lo empezaron a usar para cocinar. Cuando acabó su etapa en el pueblo y se disponía a marchar, todas las familias querían tener el honor que organizarle la cena de despedida.\n\n\"Aquellos años que van desde la Revolución Cultural hasta el final de su etapa en Shaanxi fueron un entrenamiento muy duro en una sociedad dividida entre las buenas y malas clases\", detalla Kerry Brown. \"Fue una época muy turbulenta y Xi Jinping sobrevivió\".\n\nAsí lo resumió el propio Xi años más tarde: \"Cuando llegué a los 15 años, estaba ansioso y confundido. Cuando partí a los 22, tenía firmes objetivos en mi vida y estaba lleno de confianza\". Una línea que sería luego replicada hasta la saciedad por la propaganda china.\n\nLas bases del mito ya estaban construidas. Ahora el héroe está listo para cruzar el primer umbral. Queda un arduo camino para volver a la cima del poder de la que fue desterrado. ¿El siguiente paso? Entrar al Partido Comunista. Y no iba a ser tarea fácil.\n\nAlgunos dicen que Xi Jinping fue rechazado por el Partido siete veces. Otros, nueve. Cualquiera de las cifras sirve para hacerse una idea de la obstinación de este hombre corpulento y 1,75 metros de altura por volver al sitio del que había sido expulsado. Porque, pese a todo, Xi Jinping seguía creyendo en el Partido. En 1974, tras varios rodeos, finalmente fue admitido. En términos narrativos, entramos en la fase conocida como 'la barriga de la ballena', que marca el punto de no retorno para el protagonista de la historia.\n\n\"Tenemos la idea de que, al haber sufrido tanto con Mao, la familia de Xi Jinping debería odiar al Partido\", afirma Bougon. \"Es todo lo contrario, ¡eran comunistas al 100%! Estoy convencido de que Xi Jinping tiene ideas mesiánicas sobre el Partido Comunista\". De hecho, el padre de Xi, que con el ascenso de Deng Xiaoping a la presidencia en 1978 fue perdonado tras 16 años de desprecio, lo primero que hizo fue escribir un artículo en un diario local para dejar claro que él \"ama al partido\".\n\nAlgunos de sus compañeros en la reeducación rural se sintieron traicionados por su retorno al sistema que les arruinó la juventud. \"Xi decidió sobrevivir convirtiéndose en más rojo que los rojos\", dijo en 2009 un profesor, antiguo amigo y vecino de Xi, a diplomáticos estadounidenses, según un cable publicado por WikiLeaks. El retrato que hace del joven Xi es el de un pragmático radical movido por una mezcla de \"una ambición excepcional\", una ideología flexible y un permanente sentimiento de autopreservación. Un hombre que \"difícilmente será corrompido por el dinero, pero sí por el poder\".\n\nXi es un pragmático movido por una mezcla de \"una ambición excepcional\", una ideología flexible y un sentimiento de autopreservación\n\nA su vuelta a la capital, Xi Jinping estudió ingeniería química en la prestigiosa Universidad de Tsinghua en Pekín y se sacó un doctorado en marxismo. Cuando terminó, en 1979, comenzó a trabajar como secretario de Geng Biao, ministro de Defensa e íntimo amigo de su padre. Después de los años turbulentos y oscuros, a Xi le sonreía de nuevo la vida. Contrajo matrimonio con Ke Xiaoming, hija del embajador chino en Reino Unido, de la que se divorció poco después. Además, se ganó el derecho a llevar uniforme militar -- que vestirá a diario durante años -- con el que pudo hacer importantes conexiones.\n\nVarios caminos se abrían ante él para engranarse en la élite del Partido que, ahora sí, le recibía con los brazos abiertos. En Pekín o Shanghái podría medrar en los pasillos de poder, abrirse oportunidades de negocio y codearse con la flor y nata de la alta sociedad china. Pero el joven Xi piensa a largo plazo y desprecia los atajos. Irse a las provincias \"era el único camino hacia el poder central\"; si se hubiera quedado en Pekín habría generado resentimiento y muchos enemigos, le confesaría a su antiguo amigo profesor. Así que, con 29 años, pidió que lo mandaran a Zhengding, un condado de la provincia agrícola de Hebei, donde llegó en 1982 como modesto secretario adjunto del Partido.\n\n\"No es un idealista, sino que hace las cosas de acuerdo al plan, paso por paso. Yo soy más idealista\", declaró Ke, la exesposa de Xi, en una entrevista con el diario China Digital Times en 2015. \"Al fin y al cabo, a las mujeres nos gustan los hombres que entienden el romanticismo. Pero Xi, no. A menudo sentí que era demasiado inflexible. Y eso tiene mucho que ver con cómo crecimos y con nuestra educación\".\n\nDurante esta etapa de dirigente rural, Xi experimentó con las economías de mercado, permitiendo a los agricultores utilizar más tierra para ganado en vez de sembrar los granos que exigía el mercado, mientras mantenía una imagen de humildad y trabajo, siempre con los pantalones verde olivo. En 1985, salió por primera vez de China en un viaje de dos semanas a Iowa como parte de una delegación agrícola. Allí pasó dos días en la casa de Eleanor y Thomas Dvorchak, quienes recuerdan a un hombre \"humilde\", que dormía en la habitación de sus hijos entre juguetes de Star Trek, visitando granjas locales y asistiendo interesado a un partido de béisbol.\n\nTres años después, en 1987, dejó Hebei para comenzar una etapa clave como miembro del partido y vicealcalde de la ciudad portuaria de Xiamen, en la provincia industrial de Fujian, frente a cuyas costas está Taiwán. Allí, a los 33 años, conoció a su actual esposa, la famosa soprano Peng Liyuan, de 24 años, con quien se casó poco después y tuvo una hija (Xi Mingze, quien llegaría a estudiar en Harvard inscrita bajo seudónimo). Xi aseguró posteriormente en una entrevista que decidió pedirle matrimonio 40 minutos después de conocerla.\n\nMientras, continúa con su ascenso por las carreteras secundarias del aparato comunista. Como tenía que entrevistarse con políticos e inversores extranjeros, colgó el atuendo castrense y occidentalizó su guardarropa. Es una década de trabajo silencioso y escalada administrativa de la que emerge fortalecido en 1995, nombrado secretario provincial del Partido. Pero antes, dos episodios históricos clave transformarán para siempre la visión que tiene Xi del Partido, del comunismo y de la propia China.\n\nEn la primavera de 1989, miles de estudiantes se manifestaron en la plaza de Tiananmen, en Pekín. Protestaban porque el pueblo apenas sobrevivía en la miseria mientras la élite comunista crecía rica y corrupta. El Partido respondió sacando los tanques a la calle y cientos de personas murieron por la represión militar. Xi Jinping y su padre vieron en esas protestas la semilla de la destrucción que presenciaron durante la Revolución Cultural, una época de \"superstición y estupidez\". Décadas más tarde, cuando le preguntaron si temía que pudiera volver a suceder algo parecido, él asintió: \"Sin estabilidad, ni unidad, todo es posible\".\n\nMeses después, ese mismo 1989, comenzaría el llamado Otoño de las Naciones. Una oleada de revoluciones en el espacio soviético que no se detendría hasta el colapso definitivo de la URSS en diciembre de 1991. De un día para otro, la superpotencia que plantó cara a Estados Unidos durante décadas y ofreció un camino alternativo al de las democracias liberales capitalistas desparecía prácticamente de un plumazo.\n\nAmbos capítulos operaron una transformación fundamental en el pensamiento de Xi Jinping. Es imposible saber las ideas en crudo del futuro líder chino sobre estos capítulos. No existe ninguna indiscreción a algún amigo íntimo, ni ningún ataque de sinceridad epistolar. La propaganda decidió reinterpretar estos fenómenos históricos para convertirlos en las preceptivas peripecias que darán al 'héroe' las herramientas para consumar más tarde su destino: espada mágica, hechizo arcano o anillo único. Llámalo como quieras. En este caso, 'comunismo milenario'.\n\nPara Xi, Tiananmen evidenció que en China ya no se puede \"hacer la revolución\" por lo que el Partido Comunista debía buscar otra legitimidad previa a la del 49. El Partido debía regresar a las raíces nacionalistas y rescatar esa China milenaria imperial. Mientras Mao quería acabar con el confucianismo, Xi citaría habitualmente al filósofo para recalcar la importancia de la obediencia y el orden, promoviendo la idea de que el Partido es el guardián de una civilización de 5.000 años de antigüedad. Esto, por supuesto, sin renunciar al propio Mao.\n\n\"Ideológicamente, el presidente Xi siempre ha tenido tres creencias\", explica Shi Yinhong, profesor de Relaciones Internacionales en la Universidad de Renmin y asesor del Consejo de Estado chino, a El Confidencial. \"La primera, es la creencia de la grandeza china, reforzada por la doctrina de Confucio del rol civilizatorio de la nación china sobre el resto del mundo y por el nacionalismo moderno chino para ajustar el desequilibrio y las injusticias en el planeta. La segunda, una idea de un Partido Comunista firme y disciplinado comandado por un único líder para conducir al país. Y la tercera, la firme convicción de que el Estado debe penetrar en la vida de todos los chinos. Y Xi Jinping considera estos dos últimos puntos como precondiciones de la consecución del primero\".\n\n\"El Partido Comunista Chino de Xi es esa mezcla de comunismo, nacionalismo, nostalgia de un pasado dorado y el ansia de regresar a ese pasado\", explica Bougon. Es lo que más tarde acabaría llamándose \"socialismo con características chinas para una nueva era\". En ese sentido, afirma el analista francés, Xi siempre fue el \"mejor líder\" para hacerlo realidad.\n\n\"Xi piensa que las manifestaciones deben ser prevenidas con propaganda\"\n\nPor su parte, la implosión del campo soviético obsesionó a la generación de Xi y marcó profundamente su visión de Occidente. Aunque el hundimiento tuvo muchas causas -- la falta de crecimiento económico, la corrupción, la caída del precio del petróleo o la carrera armamentística, por mencionar algunos -- Xi Jinping agregó otro factor, explica Richard McGregor en el libro '': la infiltración de valores occidentales subversivos y el tóxico papel del aperturista Gorvachov.\n\nEn palabras del propio Xi. \"El Partido Comunista Soviético, proporcionalmente, tenía más miembros que el chino, pero nadie fue lo suficientemente hombre como para alzarse y resistir\", reflexionaría años más tarde en un discurso interno para cuadros del Partido. \"Rechazar la historia de la Unión Soviética y del Partido Comunista soviético, rechazar Lenin y Stalin, y rechazar todo esto es abrazar el nihilismo histórico. Confunde nuestras ideas y debilita las organizaciones del Partido a todos los niveles\".\n\nPara evitarlo, comprendió que era fundamental que los intereses del Partido Comunista y del Ejército de Liberación Popular estuvieran alineados. Xi Jinping pensaba que las manifestaciones estudiantiles eran peligrosas y caóticas: debían ser prevenidas con propaganda y solucionadas con violencia. Según explica Joseph Torigian, profesor en la 'American University' y autor de varios estudios sobre la evolución de China desde Mao hasta Xi Jinping, el líder chino considera que los escépticos deben alinearse con el Partido y reconocer que solo el PCCh y el comunismo pueden salvar China. Este es el nuevo credo.\n\nSegún vamos avanzando en la historia de Xi Jinping, crecen las lagunas biográficas. Apenas hay información de sus años como engranaje en la gran maquinaria del partido. Xi no tuvo grandes escándalos, ni reveses. No hizo declaraciones altisonantes, ni tomó decisiones arriesgadas. Con el cambio de siglo, el político chino seguía una carrera anodina cultivando la imagen de abnegado funcionario que esquiva los asuntos políticos más espinosos y se centra solo en una cosa: la economía.\n\nEl comunismo chino ya había superado con Deng Xiaoping la gran contradicción de combinar el socialismo autoritario político con el liberalismo económico en pleno despeque de la globalización. A mediados de los años 80, durante una comida en el Cosmos Club en Washington, el politólogo Tom Robinson le preguntó a Chen Yuan, futuro director del Banco Chino de Desarrollo, cómo manejaba la aparente incoherencia entre las reformas económicas capitalistas que estaba emprendiendo su gobierno y la ideología marxista del Partido Comunista. Después de varias preguntas, Chen, molesto por la insistencia de su interlocutor, dejó el tenedor y su cuchillo sobre la mesa. \"Escuche, señor Robinson\" -- dijo en tono solemne -- \"somos el Partido Comunista de China y nosotros definiremos lo que es el comunismo\".\n\nEn 2002, Xi asumió el cargo de la pujante provincia de Zhejiang, en la costa oriental del país. El gigante asiático acaba de ingresar en la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC), lo que abría toda una nueva dimensión de retos y oportunidades. Con tanta visibilidad política, cualquier paso en falso podía acabar con su carrera. Así que el verdadero desafío para Xi, como años antes, era sobrevivir. Y para ello debía evitar caer en el fuego cruzado de las volubles guerras internas del Partido.\n\nEn esos años, un periodista local le preguntó cómo puntuaría su gestión: \"¿Te darías un 100 o un 90?\". \"Ninguna de las dos\", respondió Xi, relata Evan Osnos en su perfil 'Nacido Rojo' publicado por 'The New Yorker'. \"Un número tan alto como 100 parecería presumir de forma gratuita y un número tan bajo como 90 reflejaría baja autoestima\".\n\nXi llevó a cabo varias políticas para promover el sector privado y contribuir al pantagruélico crecimiento chino, pero ninguna demasiado controvertida. \"Mi estrategia es calentar el cazo con un fuego pequeño, pero continuo, echando agua fría para evitar que hierva\", aseguró en una ocasión. Pese a los avances, sabía que seguía siendo un terreno ideológico pantanoso. Algo que aprendió cuando su padre pasó al ostracismo definitivo en 1987 por defender las reformas económicas como única forma de sacar al pueblo chino de la pobreza.\n\n\"Cómo llegó Xi Jinping a la cima de la jerarquía del Partido sigue siendo un gran misterio\"\n\nDesde entonces, Xi se justificaba ante los intelectuales comunistas más ortodoxos que renegaban del imparable auge del capitalismo en la sociedad china con metáforas y circunloquios. La empresa privada es \"una flor exótica en el jardín del socialismo con características chinas\". Una flor que permitió levantar gigantescos rascacielos por todo el país, construir miles de kilómetros de trenes de alta velocidad, disparar sus exportaciones, remodelar sus Fuerzas Armadas y agigantar su economía para consolidar a China como la fábrica del mundo. En los 40 años desde que Den Xiaoping arrancó el proceso de Reforma y Apertura, el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) se disparó un 8.000% pasando de 150.000 millones de dólares en 1978 a 12.240.000 millones en 2018, según la ONU. \"Ellos piensan que el capitalismo no es un fin en sí mismo, sino un medio para crear un país más poderoso\", explica Brown. \"Creen en el mercado para fortalecerse a ellos mismos\".\n\nEn marzo de 2007, la carrera de Xi Jinping dio un inesperado acelerón. Un caso de corrupción lo catapultó a la poderosa secretaría del Partido de Shanghái y, en octubre de ese mismo año, selló su ascenso a la cúspide en el 17º Congreso del Partido, donde fue nombrado como uno de los siete miembros del todopoderoso Comité Permanente del Politburó, ubicado por delante de Li Keqiang, actual primer ministro y eterno aspirante a la presidencia. Su contribución a los exitosos Juegos Olímpicos de 2008 le otorgaron un aura pública de eficacia. Y ya en 2010 era considerado 'el sucesor' oficial.\n\n\"Mantener un perfil bajo puede haber sido un activo. No haber expresado 'opiniones fuertes', irónicamente, pudo haber sido un punto a su favor. Que sepamos, hubo pocas cosas que él dijera o hiciera antes de ascender a lo más alto que provocara una gran controversia\", explica Jeff Waserstrom, experto en China y autor de la pieza '¿Por qué no hay biografías de Xi Jinping?'. \"Pero cómo Xi Jinping llegó exactamente a la cima de la jerarquía del Partido sigue siendo uno de los grandes misterios que le rodean\".\n\nAquí llegamos al momento crucial en la biografía de Xi. Ese pasaje de 'muerte y renacimiento' al que obligan los cánones de la mitología para consumar la metamorfosis del protagonista. En noviembre de 2012, con su nombramiento como secretario general del Partido Comunista, desaparece el Xi Jinping discreto que rehuía el conflicto con sus pares. En su lugar aflora 'Xi Dada' (el gran tío Xi, como lo llaman los medios oficiales), una personalidad completamente inesperada cuya ambición irá creciendo según se afianza en el poder.\n\nEsta es una época en la que el Partido ya no podía controlar todos los rincones de la sociedad china como en los 70. El país comenzaba a aceptar una mayor permisividad editorial, un internet cada vez más libre y una sociedad paulatinamente más permeable a las tendencias y opiniones internacionales. Emergía la China más capitalista y muchos quisieron intuir una crisis en el modelo comunista.\n\nAsí que, en un primer momento, la aparición de un prácticamente desconocido Xi pilló fuera de juego a muchos sinólogos y observadores internacionales, que especulaban con el perfil del hombre que venía a reemplazar al gris y funcionarial Hu Jintao. Las hipótesis iban desde los que creían (o temían) que se trataba de una marioneta de la vieja guardia comunista para reprimir un aperturismo que se les estaba yendo de las manos, a los que esperaban (o más bien, deseaban) que fuera un Mijaíl Gorvachov chino que desmontara el sistema de partido único.\n\nPero Xi estaba decidido a ser Xi.\n\n\"Xi Jinping ve a Gorbachov como un fracaso\", afirma Kerry Brown. \"La década de los noventa en Rusia fue una época terrible, por lo que Xi Jinping ve la caída de la Unión Soviética de una forma muy distinta a cómo la ve Europa o Estados Unidos. Por supuesto, no cree que esto fuera positivo para el mundo\". Cuando asumió el mando en Pekín, el líder obligó a todos los cuadros del partido a ver un documental de seis capítulos sobre por qué el Partido Comunista soviético había colapsado de esa manera tan espectacular y, en particular, el papel de las subversivas ideas occidentales para promover la llamada 'evolución pacífica' hacia la democracia.\n\n\"Los comunistas chinos siempre han estado muy obsesionados con lo que ocurrió en la URSS y nunca aceptarán que pase lo mismo en China. Por eso mismo, nunca permitirán 'Glasnost', 'Perestroika', ni cualquier atisbo de democracia\", sostiene Bougon.\n\nEn innumerables ocasiones, Xi se ha descrito a sí mismo como el líder que viene a salvar a China de la corrupción, la ineficiencia, la contaminación, las protestas en Hong Kong, del terrorismo en Xinjiang, la injerencia extranjera, la crisis económica y la desunión de la nación. Con semejante tarea -- justifica el discurso oficial -- él y sus aliados tendrían que volver a retomar el timón de la sociedad a cualquier precio. Y el tiempo que haga falta.\n\n\"Tiran a la basura el 'software' marxista, pero todavía usan el 'hardware' soviético. Le han dado un toque de McKinsey para asegurarse el éxito\"\n\nLas bases eran sólidas -- describe Bo Zhiyue, nominado al Premio Tang, el 'Nobel de la sinología' -- pues el PCCh es \"un partido leninista bien organizado bajo el principio del centralismo democrático. En cierto sentido, es como la Iglesia Católica, con comités a todos los niveles y ramas del partido en organizaciones y empresas. Con el principio de que debe liderar todos los ámbitos, el Partido Comunista con sus más 92 millones de miembros ha penetrado la vida cotidiana de los chinos de muchísimas formas\".\n\nPero necesitaba una actualización para adaptarse al siglo XXI. Para ello, Xi aceleró un proceso que ya llevaba varios en marcha. \"Tirar a la basura el 'software' marxista, pero seguir utilizando el 'hardware' soviético\", en palabras de Richard McGregor en '', libro de referencia para entender la organización comunista china. El sistema sigue siendo \"podrido, costoso, corrupto y disfuncional\" pero, al mismo tiempo, tan \"flexible y proteico\" como para absorber cualquier crisis. \"La burocracia leninista sobrevive, pero le ha dado un toque de McKinsey para asegurarse de que tiene éxito\", concluye McGregor.\n\nCinco meses después de llegar a la jefatura del Partido, Xi era confirmado presidente de la República Popular China el 14 de marzo de 2013. Ahora podría hacer realidad su revelación: el Sueño Chino. Una virtuosa combinación de prosperidad, unidad y fortaleza que dará lugar \"al gran rejuvenecimiento de la nación\" y un cambio de paradigma económico basado en la innovación. Una revitalización que pasaba, necesariamente, por limpiar la casa.\n\nEnarbolando la lucha contra la corrupción, Xi lanzó una campaña para cazar \"tigres y moscas\" -- referencia para identificar a dirigentes del Partido y funcionarios de base -- . No había terminado 2014 y más de 100.000 miembros del PCCh ya habían sido arrestados. Para 2016, la cifra de investigados superaba el millón. De un plumazo, el nuevo hombre fuerte de China pudo purgar la administración, alejar a sus rivales del poder y lanzar un mensaje claro a sus compatriotas, que llevaban décadas resintiéndose ante la creciente corrupción que minaba la omnipresente burocracia estatal.\n\n\"Si queréis dinero, no os unáis al Partido\", fue el eslogan de Xi que acompañó a la caída de los primeros pesos pesados del sistema. Algunos ejemplos fueron el temido Zhou Yongkang, quien en 2015 se convirtió en el miembro más alto del Partido en ser juzgado -- y condenado a cadena perpetua -- por corrupción, o el carismático Bo Xilai, ambos acusados de conspirar para destruir la unidad del PCCh.\n\nPese al espeso barniz de la propaganda, la efectividad de la campaña ha sido cuestionada y los escándalos que involucran a funcionarios de todo rango han seguido sucediéndose. Sobornos, malversación y abusos de poder de toda calaña. Hasta la familia del propio Xi ha sido señalada por mover millonarias cantidades al extranjero, según investigaciones de 'The New York Times'. Hace unos años, en una visita ese pueblo remoto donde se hizo un hombre, Xi llevó despertadores para todos los habitantes pero, según una investigación posterior de 'Los Ángeles Times', el secretario de partido acaparó varios para sus amigos y muchos en el pueblo se quedaron sin relojes.\n\n\"El movimiento contra la corrupción por parte de Xi Jinping puede verse como un atractivo populista, de ahí que se haya promovido tanto la imagen de que él es muy duro contra la corrupción\", recalca Wasserstram. \"Muchos de los objetivos han sido rivales políticos por lo que hay un ajuste de cuentas detrás. Pero si le dices a la gente en China que detrás de esta campaña anticorrupción hay un intento de 'vendetta', te dirán: 'quizá, pero es bueno que algunos corruptos sean apartados del poder'\".\n\nPero la mano dura no se reservó solo para los corruptos. Mientras Xi se presentaba ante la escena internacional en 2014 decidido a llevar al \"socialismo con características chinas\" a nuevas cotas globales con la llamada 'Belt and Road' o Nueva Ruta de la Seda -- un megaproyecto de inversión planetaria con presencia en más de 130 países que representan el 48% de la población mundial -- , dentro de China cualquier cuestionamiento a su autoridad era (y es) brutalmente reprimida. Desde Xinjiang hasta Hong Kong, desde Taiwán hasta las entrañas de internet, cualquier disenso que ponga en peligro la estabilidad del Partido -- y, por tanto, la de Xi en el poder -- sería rápidamente eliminada.\n\n\"Es un imaginario imperial. Cualquier crítica se ve como un ataque contra su dignidad\"\n\nEl Partido erigió una maquinaria distópica de control digital para supervisar los movimientos, pensamientos y el comportamiento de la población. El presidente aplastó incluso los pequeños oasis de oposición política y cultural, blindando a la sociedad china de cualquier roce con la cultura occidental. Instagram, Facebook, Google y grandes medios estadounidenses quedaron vetados en la China continental. \"Si no das un golpe en la mesa de vez en cuando, si no transmites el suficiente miedo, la gente no te tomará en serio\", dijo a un entrevistador chino en 2003 sobre su estilo de gestión.\n\nMusulmanes, cristianos, abogados, blogueros y todo tipo de activistas han sido encarcelados por expresar sus convicciones. El celo de los censores ha llegado a extremos ridículos, como la cruzada que mantienen contra toda una serie de memes que se burlan del supuesto parecido entre el presidente chino y el popular dibujo animado 'Winnie the Pooh'. Sienten que la ridiculización debilita al mito y eso puede ser peligroso.\n\n\"Ellos están obsesionados con la estabilidad. Cualquier intento que quiera hacerles daño, aunque sea una inofensiva biografía, lo ven como una amenaza y un posible ataque\", destaca Kerry Brown. \"Es una especie de imaginario imperial. El poder de Xi Jinping y el propio Xi Jinping tiene que estar por encima y más allá de cualquier amenaza, porque cualquier crítica se ve como un ataque contra su dignidad\".\n\nEl Gobierno chino ya no teme al dedo acusador occidental. Cuando los cuestionan, sea por los campos de concentración de los uigures, por incumplir la promesa 'un país, dos sistemas' en Hong Kong o por su creciente apetito sobre Taiwán, funcionarios y medios citan las palabras Xi.\n\n\"Algunos extranjeros con los estómagos llenos y nada mejor que hacer se dedican a señalarnos con el dedo\", afirmó en un inusual ataque de sinceridad durante una rueda de prensa en México en 2009, criticando que Occidente aplicara su marco de pensamiento 'imperialista' a Pekín. \"Primero, China no exporta revolución. Segundo, no exporta hambre y pobreza. Y tercero, no va liándola por ahí. ¿Qué más hay que decir?\".\n\nA estas alturas, Xi Jinping se ha convertido en un agujero negro del que no sale información. Ya solo refleja propaganda. Un individuo que se ha hecho irremplazable tras ir asumiendo -- o creando -- una decena de títulos para sí, monopolizando desde los clásicos comités más influyentes del Partido (política exterior, Taiwán, economía) a los nuevos entes que supervisan internet, la reforma militar o la seguridad nacional. \"El presidente de todo\", le apodaron en un informe.\n\nRetratos y bustos presiden oficinas oficiales, escuelas, cuarteles y hogares. Omnipresente en las calles y en internet, el presidente 'protagoniza' su propia serie de dibujos animados que anima a los párvulos a \"ser como Xi\". Las medallas y suvenires con su efigie compiten con los de Mao en los puestos callejeros. Los medios oficiales proyectan una idílica imagen pública de presidente 24/7, frugal y disciplinado, que evita los banquetes y a veces usa una furgoneta en vez de limusina. Unos hábitos que quiere imponer como cultura corporativa del Partido y la nación. En el manual 'Las Ocho Reglas', Xi especificó áreas de mejora para los funcionarios, incluyendo la necesidad de acabar con \"el desperdicio y las extravagancias\".\n\nLa estatura política de Xi va creciendo dentro y fuera de China. En octubre de 2017, el 19º Congreso Nacional del Partido Comunista incorpora a la Constitución una nueva doctrina política que pasará a estudiarse en universidades y escuelas: el 'Pensamiento de Xi Jinping sobre el socialismo con características chinas para una Nueva Era'. Una distinción que lo pone ideológicamente al nivel de Mao y Deng Xiaoping.\n\nAl año siguiente, con el férreo control ideológico y ejecutivo del Partido, la economía rebotando tras varios años de ralentización y sus rivales geopolíticos inmersos en crisis existenciales (el trumpismo en EEUU y el Brexit en la UE), el presidente chino se lanza a enmendar la Constitución para permitir su reelección indefinida. De 2.964 delegados, solo dos votaron en contra y tres, en blanco. No solo ha alcanzado en solitario la cúspide, sino que ha despejado el camino para asegurarse que le da tiempo a cumplir 'su misión'.\n\n\"China no exporta revolución. No exporta hambre. Y no va liándola por ahí. ¿Qué más hay que decir?\"\n\nPekín siente que salió reforzada de la pandemia. Pese a ser el país origen del coronavirus, consiguió controlar la epidemia rápidamente. Su economía no solo evitó la recesión, sino que el Gobierno aseguró haber logrado erradicar la pobreza extrema, un ambicioso objetivo que se había fijado antes de la crisis sanitaria. Antes de la guerra en Ucrania, el Centro para la Investigación Económica y Empresarial pronosticaba que el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) chino podría superar al estadounidense en 2028, cinco años antes de lo previsto.\n\nLos medios estatales chinos aprovecharon para endosar al máximo líder -- \"el hombre que se ha echado el país a las espaldas\" -- el éxito en conjurar el desastre. Gracias a su actuación decisiva, siguen repitiendo periódicos, radios y televisiones estatales -- , China evitó una crisis mayor. Nada se habla sobre cómo los cuadros locales ocultaron la crisis sanitaria por miedo a represalias de Pekín, ralentizando la respuesta global a la catástrofe que se venía encima.\n\nEl panorama está lejos de ser idílico. Primero, pese a que los chinos que han participado en estudios como el Proyecto Pew Global Attitudes han mostrado opiniones altamente favorables a su líder, en realidad es imposible auscultar la opinión pública china. Lo mismo pasa con las tendencias y ambiciones en el seno del Partido Comunista, una organización imposible de fiscalizar. La economía pasa por un momento delicado por la insistencia en mantener la política de 'Cero covid'; la demografía empeora y la trampa de ingreso medio (una situación de estancamiento que ya han vivido otras grandes economías emergentes antes que Pekín) acecha peligrosamente. Mientras, la imagen de China ha salido perjudicada en algunos sectores de la opinión pública internacional.\n\n\"Si hay menos crecimiento económico, la gente tendrá que hacer más sacrificios y el Partido Comunista se tendrá que justificar. ¿Cómo? Agitando la bandera del nacionalismo\", destaca Kerry Brown. \"Eso también será un problema dentro de China, porque el nacionalismo crea su propia bestia y se perpetúa\".\n\nA esta historia solo le queda un capítulo y es de confrontación.\n\nEn la lógica mitológica de la propaganda china, todos los caminos que ha recorrido el 'héroe' -- privilegio, purga, rehabilitación y ascenso -- lo han llevado inevitablemente hasta aquí: el momento exacto para que afronte su destino. Pero ¿cuál es exactamente su meta final? ¿Qué busca el presidente?\n\n\"Xi quiere ser el gran arquitecto de la China que aspira a ser la primera economía mundial\", destaca Bougon. \"Una nación rica y próspera, respetada por la comunidad internacional y bajo el liderazgo del Partido Comunista\".\n\nEn varias oportunidades, el presidente chino ha expresado su convicción de que se debe dar paso a un nuevo orden mundial, en una clara alusión a Occidente en general y a Estados Unidos en particular. \"China nunca buscará la hegemonía, la expansión o una esfera de influencia, no importa cuán fuertes nos volvamos\", dijo durante su intervención en el Boao Forum, el Davos asiático de 2021. Luego, agregó: \"No debemos permitir que las reglas de un país o unos pocos países sean impuestas a otros ni permitir el unilateralismo con el que ciertos países quieren imponer su ritmo al resto del mundo\".\n\nLa pandemia y la guerra de Ucrania han acelerando las tendencias geopolíticas. De la estas crisis emerge una China sin complejos, comandada por un líder decidido a reclamar el liderazgo mundial. Su poderosa influencia económica, construida con discreción durante décadas, viene ahora acompañada con un tono mucho más duro en el discurso. La prudencia del \"esconde tu fuerza, espera tu momento\" que guió la política exterior china desde Deng Xiaoping ha dado paso a una agresiva diplomacia 'Wolf Warrior', reflejo de una aspiración a poner fin a la hegemonía política, económica y cultural que todavía ostenta Estados Unidos. Para muchos países de América Latina a Europa del Este, pasando por África y Asia, Xi se ha convertido en el heraldo del fin del mundo unipolar.\n\n\"En resumidas cuentas\" -- concluye Gil Bates, sinólogo australiano y profesor de estudios de seguridad indopacíficos en Macquarie University -- \"Xi Jinping quiere hacer a China grande otra vez\".","source":{"uri":"elconfidencial.com","dataType":"news","title":"El Confidencial"},"authors":[{"uri":"carlos_barragan@elconfidencial.com","name":"Carlos Barragán","type":"author","isAgency":false},{"uri":"enrique_andres_pretel@elconfidencial.com","name":"Enrique Andrés Pretel","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://images.ecestaticos.com/_HIkt4LOklVRPKRvHzF1BzvD3OE=/0x0:2272x1767/600x315/filters:fill(white):format(jpg):quality(99):watermark(f.elconfidencial.com/file/bae/eea/fde/baeeeafde1b3229287b0c008f7602058.png,0,274,1)/f.elconfidencial.com/original/9d2/e17/a3c/9d2e17a3c018498d348a8a75da6c25d0.jpg","eventUri":"eng-8090075","sentiment":null,"wgt":403555620,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226420435","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"18:43:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T18:43:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T18:32:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6705882549285889,"url":"https://www.politicususa.com/2022/10/15/obama-barnes-wisconsin.html","title":"Obama Brings Towering Presence to Campaign in Wisconsin for Barnes","body":"It is not hard to make Ron Johnson look small.

Islamist insurgents and terrorist organizations also are well positioned to expand their influence amid the political instability that has emerged in many countries. The Middle East has become an even more hostile strategic environment in which regional security, U.S. national interests, and Western values are increasingly under attack. The United States cannot afford to react with indifference.\n\nThe wave of popular uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East that shook the region's autocratic regimes in 2011 and 2012 gave rise to an unjustified euphoria in many Western media outlets and governments about an \"Arab Spring\" -- a misnomer motivated by wishful thinking. Just under two years later, the picture is not so rosy.\n\nWhile the overthrow of authoritarian regimes can give democracy a chance to bloom, in many countries it has also created opportunities for a wide spectrum of Islamist parties to exploit elections to advance their undemocratic agendas. Islamist insurgents and terrorist organizations also are well positioned to expand their influence amid the political instability that has emerged in many countries. After nearly two years of unrest, the Middle East has become an even more volatile and hostile strategic environment in which regional security, U.S. national interests, and Western values are increasingly under attack.\n\nAmerica is not the world's policeman and it cannot determine how the peoples of the Middle East live their lives or govern themselves. Washington can, however, do a much more effective job of protecting U.S. national interests and promoting peace and prosperity in an important part of the world.\n\nThe United States needs a comprehensive strategy to combat Islamist regimes that promote agendas counter to American interests and that suppress opportunities for political, religious, and economic freedom. This strategy must be global in scope, but be crafted to fit different situations in specific regions and countries. Further, a U.S. strategy to counter hostile Islamist political groups must work in concert with a second strategy to combat the rising global Islamist insurgency and associated acts of transnational terrorism. As top priority, the focus of both strategies must be on the Middle East and North Africa -- the center of the \"Arab Spring.\" Meanwhile, there are some critical first steps the U.S. can take now to hold fledgling governments accountable, promote economic freedom, and diminish the threat of transnational terrorism.\n\nThe popular rebellions that erupted in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and, to a lesser extent, in other Arab countries during the so-called Arab Spring are works in progress that, so far, have yielded a variety of outcomes. In many cases, the broad ad hoc coalitions that ousted authoritarian regimes dissolved in acrimony, power struggles, and ideological clashes that continue to undermine stability in the region. Islamists seeking to impose harsh interpretations of Sharia law, which restricts freedoms, particularly of religious minorities and women, have emerged as leading contenders for power.\n\nIslamists pose an ideological threat to Western values, though not necessarily an immediate security threat to the United States, unless they support terrorism or violent revolution. Anti-American terrorism is often an outgrowth of Islamist totalitarian movements, such as al-Qaeda, which use terrorism as a tool to advance revolutionary goals such as the imposition of a harsh and intolerant brand of Sharia, the creation of a totalitarian Islamist state, and the eventual global caliphate. Al-Qaeda is much more than a terrorist group -- it sees itself as the vanguard of a global Islamist totalitarian revolution. To this end, it seeks to exploit local and regional conflicts to advance its vision of a global Islamist insurgency.\n\nAl-Qaeda and other Islamist totalitarians not only pose an immediate threat to the United States but also to a wide spectrum of Muslims and non-Muslims in the region who could be potential allies of the United States. Al-Qaeda cloaks its totalitarian goals in Islamic religious symbols and claims to be defending Islam, but it has killed more Muslims than non-Muslims and more Arabs than Americans. To defeat the terrorist threat posed by al-Qaeda, the United States must recognize the appeal of the group's revolutionary ideology and expose it as a threat to the lives and freedoms of Muslims.\n\nTo prevent al-Qaeda and other Islamist totalitarian groups from exploiting the turbulence of the Arab Spring to advance their radical agenda, the United States should seek allies in Arab governments, secular groups, tribal leaders, and other groups threatened by Islamist totalitarians. It should also engage Muslim religious groups and political parties if they reject violence and unequivocally support democratic principles.[1]\n\nThe \"Arab Spring\" that began in 2011 has ushered in an unprecedented political transformation that has devolved in varying degrees into a chaotic \"Islamist Winter\" in many Arab countries that increasingly threatens U.S. national interests. Washington lost a key strategic partner when Egypt's Mubarak regime was replaced by one dominated by the anti-Western Muslim Brotherhood. Other regional allies in Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen now face mounting challenges posed by Islamist-dominated political opposition movements.\n\nWhere elections have been held, anti-Western Islamist political parties of various stripes, that are ideologically predisposed to oppose U.S. foreign policy goals, have generally been the chief beneficiaries. Although they cloak their radical agendas in lip service to democratic ideals, their ultimate goal is to subvert genuine democracy by exploiting elections as a means to vault to power and impose Sharia law.[2]\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's euphemistically named Freedom and Justice Party won Egypt's elections and the Ennahda (Renaissance) party was boosted to power in Tunisia's elections. Although Islamists did not do as well in Libya's elections, they are exploiting the continued chaos, factional infighting, ethnic tensions, and tribal frictions that Libya's fledgling government appears unable to resolve. Chronic political turbulence in Libya eventually may allow Islamists to hijack the revolution, as they have done elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to removing or weakening regimes aligned with the United States, the Arab uprisings have empowered Islamist extremists who did not play a large role during the initial phases of the uprisings. It has weakened security cooperation between the affected Arab governments and the U.S. and strengthened Islamist terrorist groups, particularly in Egypt, Libya, Mali, Syria, and Yemen. Al-Qaeda and other Islamist revolutionary groups who were sidelined in the early phases of peaceful protest campaigns are now well positioned to expand their power, sometimes at the expense of Islamist political parties and sometimes in complicity with them.\n\nThe erosion of state authority has severely undermined border controls in many regions, allowing Islamic militant groups to move men, arms, and money across increasingly porous borders in failed or failing states. Libyan arms seized from the Qadhafi regime's huge stockpiles have bolstered Islamist insurgents and terrorists in Algeria, Egypt, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Tunisia. Some have turned up in Gaza in the hands of Hamas and other Islamist extremists fighting Israel.\n\nThe rising tide of Islamism has also increased the likelihood of another Arab-Israeli war. It has emboldened Hamas and other Palestinian Islamist militants, who seek to pull an increasingly supportive Egypt into the conflict to tilt the balance of power against Israel. The peace treaties that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan, two of the chief American diplomatic achievements that have bolstered regional stability in recent decades, could soon unravel as the region is roiled by intensifying Arab-Israeli tensions.\n\nThe outcome of the Arab uprisings is likely to be different in each country, depending on the strength of the contending political forces, the willingness of ruling regimes to accommodate popular demands for change, the capacity of regimes to resist change, and the balance of power between rival political factions that seek to fill the political vacuums created by sudden political upheavals. The countries burdened with the worst dictatorships -- Libya, Syria, and Yemen -- long have suffered from ravaged civil societies, and have been wracked by bitter civil wars that will make successful transitions to stable democracies exceedingly difficult.\n\nMoreover, no revolution in the Middle East has advanced democracy and stability in the host country since Turkey's secular revolution in the 1920s. Islamists that have come to power in recent decades in Afghanistan, Gaza, Iran, and Sudan have sacrificed the freedom and welfare of their own people in pursuit of radical agendas that include exporting their revolutions, external aggression, and internal repression.\n\nThe bottom line is that the initial democratic impetus that infused many of the disparate groups that launched the Arab uprisings is not likely to last through the course of the unpredictable political revolutions that have been set in motion. When the revolutions start eating their children, idealistic democrats, liberals, and secularists are likely to be swallowed up by better organized, better funded, highly motivated Islamist movements or by military leaders who seek to restore order in societies wracked by political infighting.\n\nIdeological Challenges. Islamist political parties, even so-called moderates that have come to power in elections, will inevitably blame the U.S. and the West for the problems of their own countries. Once in power, they will be ill equipped to solve the urgent economic and social problems faced by their own societies, and naturally will scapegoat the U.S. to escape blame for deteriorating economic and social conditions. As Husain Haqqani, co-editor of the Hudson Institute's Current Trends in Islamist Ideology, has noted:\n\nThe ideology of Islamist revivalism, rooted in a culture of grievance and victimhood, remains powerful. Newly elected Islamist governments in some Arab countries, such as Egypt, will most likely fuel hatred of the West as substitute for economic and social progress, just as Iran has done since the 1979 revolution. This, in turn, will continue to produce a steady flow of terrorists ready to kill Americans.[3]\n\nTunisia probably has the best chance of becoming a stable democracy, given its relatively large middle class, well-educated population, and relatively secular political culture. But even there, there are disturbing trends, including an increasingly strident Salafi movement and crude efforts to indoctrinate the next generation to support al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremist movements. The Middle East Media Research Institute discovered a chilling video in which Islamist extremists teach young children to sing a song in support of al-Qaeda:\n\nOur leader Bin Laden is America's worst nightmare,\n\nwith the power of faith and our weapon, the PK machine-gun.\n\nIf they call me a terrorist, I will consider it an honor.\n\nOur terror is blessed, a divine call.\n\nWe destroyed America with a civilian airplane --\n\nthe World Trade Center was turned into rubble.[4]\n\nThe traditional monarchies of the Arab world have so far escaped the worst excesses of the Arab uprisings. The Arab kings were generally perceived to have more political legitimacy than many of the leaders of politically bankrupt false republics. Several kingdoms were insulated from protests by virtue of their religious credentials: The kings of Jordan and Morocco claim to be descendants of the prophet Mohammed, and the Saudi royal family benefited from their close ties to the Wahhabi religious establishment and status as custodians of the holy city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia has also used its oil wealth to co-opt many of its citizens who seek greater political power.\n\nBut this relative calm may not last much longer, particularly in Jordan, where King Abdullah has been undermined by spillover from Syria's increasingly bloody civil war and by adverse economic trends, some of which were exacerbated by the repeated sabotage of oil pipelines from Egypt by Islamist terrorists operating in the Sinai. But the crucial theater for the future evolution of the Arab uprisings is likely to be Egypt.\n\nEgypt, the most populous Arab state, is a key player in Arab politics, culture, and ideology. The popular uprising against the Mubarak regime did not trigger an immediate revolution, instead prompting a February 2011 military coup that left the ruling military elite in an uncomfortable triangular relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and the liberal reformers that had played a leading role in the opening phase of the revolt. But, given the relatively tiny size of Egypt's middle-class and Westernized elites, it was clear from the beginning that the Facebook and Twitter appeals that so impressed Western media would not carry the same weight with the bulk of the Egyptian electorate.[5] Many Egyptians voted as they were told by the leaders of local mosques by selecting pictograms on the ballots (approximately 30 percent of Egyptians are illiterate).\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood eventually consolidated its political dominance by outmaneuvering Egypt's military establishment, which had acted as a brake on its power after it finished first in Egypt's 2011 parliamentary elections. President Mohamed Morsi reversed the military coup with a counter coup by exploiting an August 2012 attack by Islamist militants in the Sinai, which killed 16 Egyptian soldiers, to purge the army's top ranks and establish his unfettered political primacy.\n\nPresident Morsi, a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood, has set Egypt on a troubling new foreign policy course since coming to power in June. His government has distanced itself from Washington, while bolstering ties to China and improving relations with Iran. Morsi's first trip outside the Middle East was to China. He embraced Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at an Islamic summit in Saudi Arabia and became the first Egyptian leader to visit Iran since the 1979 revolution when he traveled to Tehran for the August 2012 Non-Aligned Movement summit.\n\nMorsi has also radically altered Egypt's relations with Hamas, the Palestinian offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was regarded with hostility and suspicion by the previous regime. He invited Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh to Cairo and eased border restrictions between Gaza and Egypt. Cairo has also aggressively inserted itself in the recent Gaza crisis. After Israel's retaliation for multiple days of rocket attacks from Gaza with air strikes that killed the leader of Hamas's terrorist wing and targeted Palestinian rocket-launching, storage, and manufacturing sites, Morsi blasted Israel and withdrew Egypt's ambassador from Jerusalem. He also dispatched Prime Minister Hisham Kandil to Gaza to express Egyptian solidarity with Hamas. Egypt also brokered a cease-fire that halted the fighting on November 21. Morsi has exploited the Israel-Gaza crisis to boost his political position at home, weaken ties with Israel, and escalate Egypt's cooperation with Hamas.\n\nMorsi's government has also undermined Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. After Islamist militants killed 16 Egyptian border guards in the Sinai on August 5, Cairo deployed tanks in close proximity to the Israeli border, a violation of the U.S.-brokered treaty.[6] Under the terms of that agreement, tanks are restricted to the western Sinai within 30 miles of the Suez Canal.\n\nThe violent September 11 protests and attacks on the U.S. embassy in Cairo have deepened American concerns about Egypt's new government. Despite advance warning about plans by ultra-radical Islamists to mount a protest demonstration on September 11, 2012, Egyptian security forces were suspiciously lax in restraining the crowd, which invaded the embassy grounds, tore down the American flag, and replaced it with a flag that resembled al-Qaeda's black banner.\n\nPresident Morsi's nonchalant public reaction to the attack only compounded the problem. Instead of immediately denouncing the attack and taking action to upgrade security around the embassy, as Libyan and Yemeni leaders have done after similar events, Morsi waited a day before issuing a mild rebuke to the rioters via Facebook. Morsi's ambivalent approach to fulfilling Egypt's legal obligation to protect foreign diplomats did little to reassure Washington or deter future riots at the embassy. Morsi belatedly promised to protect U.S. diplomats in a phone call with President Barack Obama and a statement issued in Brussels.\n\nA previous terrorist attack in August 2011, which had also emanated from the Sinai, had prompted an Israeli military response that inadvertently killed five Egyptian soldiers, leading an Egyptian mob to attack the Israeli embassy in Cairo and force the evacuation of Israeli diplomats.\n\nProliferating Islamist Extremism. Egypt's elections not only brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power but also empowered the even more radical Salafists.[7] Their Nour Party, which finished second in the election to the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, played a leading role in the violent September 11 attack on the U.S. embassy.\n\nAnother Salafist political party, the Building and Development Party, consists of rehabilitated members of the Islamic Group, a revolutionary Islamist group that engaged in terrorism. This party seeks the release of its spiritual leader, Omar Abdel-Rahman (also known as \"the blind sheikh\"), who is serving a life sentence in the United States for his role in the 1993 plot to bomb the World Trade Center and other targets in New York City. The fact that such a radical movement garnered 13 seats in Egypt's parliament has been described as \"electoral Bin Ladenism.\"[8]\n\nUltra-radical Islamist extremists have flocked to Egypt's Sinai peninsula, which has become an increasingly lawless ungoverned space. Working with smuggling networks and radicalized Bedouins resentful of Egypt's central government, Islamist militants have carved out a staging area in remote mountains that they have used as a springboard for attacks on Israel, Egyptian security forces, tourists, and a pipeline carrying Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan. Although these attacks have benefitted the Muslim Brotherhood by providing a humiliating pretext for purging Egypt's armed forces, in the long run, such attacks could threaten its interests by sparking a war between Egypt and Israel.\n\nAl-Qaeda was caught off guard by the Arab uprisings, and played a negligible role in the initial phases of the revolts.[9] Its top leadership, whittled down in a war of attrition by arrests and drone strikes, lost some of its effectiveness because the leaders were forced to hunker down in the remote tribal badlands and cities of Pakistan and spend more time and effort in taking precautions to ensure their own security. Even before the May 2011 death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda had evolved from a centrally directed, hierarchical organization into a network of relatively independent franchises and affiliates.[10]\n\nAs popular uprisings swept the Arab Middle East and North Africa, the dominant narrative was that Islamist revolutionary groups, such as al-Qaeda, were irrelevant because their conviction that only a violent jihad could overthrow regimes was proven wrong. This may have been true where peaceful demonstrators were able to topple governments, but in countries where nonviolent demonstrations morphed into bloody civil wars, al-Qaeda has been handed renewed opportunities to attract followers, imitators, and allies.\n\nEven in \"Arab Spring\" countries that have undergone relatively peaceful transitions, such as Tunisia and Egypt, al-Qaeda may exploit reservoirs of potential recruits from among young Arabs galvanized by the political upheavals and subsequently disenchanted with the uneven and disappointing results of the uprisings. As terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman has noted, \"Al-Qaeda's core demographic has always been disenfranchised, disillusioned and marginalized youth,\" and that pool is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon.[11]\n\nAl-Qaeda is also poised to exploit failed or failing states in Libya, Mali, Syria, and Yemen. The fall of autocratic Arab regimes and the subsequent factional infighting within the ad hoc coalitions that ousted those regimes has created power vacuums that have allowed al-Qaeda franchises in North Africa and Yemen to expand the territories that they control. Rising sectarian tensions in Syria also have presented al-Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups with major opportunities to expand their activities.\n\nJonathan Evans, director general of the British security service MI5, has warned that \"parts of the Arab world have once more become a permissive environment for al-Qaeda.\"[12] In Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, the collapse or purge of intelligence and counterterrorism organizations has removed important constraints on the growth of al-Qaeda and similar Islamist terrorist groups. Many dangerous terrorists were released or escaped from prison. Al-Qaeda and other revolutionary groups were handed new opportunities to recruit, organize, attract funding for, train, and arm a new wave of followers, and to consolidate safe havens from which to mount future attacks.\n\nThis is a welcome development from al-Qaeda's viewpoint, coming at a time when its sanctuaries in Pakistan have become increasingly threatened by U.S. drone strikes. Given al-Qaeda's Arab roots, the Middle East and North Africa provide much-improved access to potential Arab recruits than the more remote regions of the tribal badlands along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where many al-Qaeda cadres fled after the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001. The countries destabilized by the Arab uprisings also could provide easier access to al-Qaeda's Europe-based cadres, who pose the most dangerous threats to the U.S. homeland by virtue of their European passports and greater ease of blending into Western societies.\n\nAl-Qaeda's regional franchises have made significant gains due to the Arab uprisings in several countries:\n\nYemen. The effects of the Arab uprisings clearly have benefitted Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) at the expense of the chronically weak government. The protracted crisis that eventually forced Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down in February 2012 diverted the attention and resources of Yemen army and security services. AQAP seized control of almost half the country before being driven back by an offensive by the new Yemeni government, augmented by escalating drone strikes conducted by the United States.\n\nAQAP has presented the most potent threat to the U.S. homeland of all the al-Qaeda franchises.[13] It launched the \"underwear bomber\" plot which attempted to destroy a civilian airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, plotted to mail bombs concealed in printer cartridges to the United States using commercial air freight shippers in 2010, and made another attempt to bomb a civilian airliner with an improved version of an \"underwear bomb\" made without metal parts, which was revealed in May 2012.\n\nLibya. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), one of al-Qaeda's weaker franchises before the Arab uprisings, has flourished in recent months and is now one of al-Qaeda's best-financed and most heavily armed franchises. The 2011 overthrow of Libya's Qaddafi regime pried open a Pandora's box of problems that AQIM has exploited. Large quantities of arms, including shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles or man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), were looted from Qadhafi's huge arms depots. An estimated 800 MANPADS, which pose a lethal threat to commercial airliners, have fallen into the hands of foreign insurgent groups after being moved out of Libya.[14] Libyan MANPADS have turned up in the hands of AQIM, the Nigerian Boko Haram terrorist group, and Hamas in Gaza. At some point, one or more could be used in a terrorist attack against a civilian airliner.\n\nThe September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi underscored the extent to which Islamist extremists have grown stronger, particularly in eastern Libya, a longtime bastion of Islamic fervor. The radical Islamist group that launched the attack, Ansar al-Sharia, has links to AQIM and shares its violent ideology. Ansar al-Sharia and scores of other Islamist militias have flourished in post-Qadhafi Libya because the weak central government has been unable to tame fractious militias, curb tribal clashes, or dampen rising tensions between Arabs and Berbers in the west and between Arabs and the African Toubou tribe in the south. As one Libyan lawyer put it: \"We have a government that exists only on paper.\"[15]\n\nMali. The fall of Qadhafi also led hundreds of heavily armed Tuareg mercenaries formerly employed by his regime to cross into Mali, where they spearheaded a Tuareg separatist insurgency against Mali's weak central government. In November 2011, they formed the separatist National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and sought to carve out an independent state. In cooperation with AQIM and the Islamist movement Ansar Dine, they gained control over northern Mali, a territory as big as Texas, which is now the largest terrorist sanctuary in the world.[16] The success of AQIM and allied movements in Mali has helped to advance AQIM's self-declared long-term goal of transforming the Sahel \"into one vast, seething, chaotic Somalia.\"[17]\n\nSyria. Outside of Yemen, Syria provides perhaps the most promising theater for expanding al-Qaeda influence. The opposition to the Alawite-dominated Assad regime is predominantly Sunni, and al-Qaeda's Sunni supremacist ideology is likely to resonate strongly in the increasingly sectarian civil war. Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which developed a logistical infrastructure in Syria to move men, arms, and money into Iraq during the peak fighting there, now has reversed the flow across Syria's porous border. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before Congress in 2012 that \"we believe that Al-Qaeda in Iraq is extending its reach into Syria.\"[18]\n\nIraq. Although AQI had been severely degraded by U.S. and Iraqi security forces in an intensive counter-terrorism campaign from 2006 to 2011, the resilient terrorist organization has revived and thrived after the withdrawal of U.S. troops in December 2011. AQI has exploited renewed sectarian tensions between the predominantly Shia Iraqi government and Iraq's disgruntled Sunni minority to stage a bloody comeback. U.S. and Iraqi officials estimate that AQI has more than doubled in numbers from a year ago to about 2,500 fighters and is launching about 140 attacks a week in Iraq.[19] AQI's leadership has grown cocky enough to threaten attacks \"in the heart\" of America.[20] Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, assessed that this threat must be taken seriously, given the arrests of several associates of the terrorist group in the United States and Canada in recent years.[21]\n\nThe ultimate results of the Arab uprisings will differ in each country. Washington cannot craft a one-size-fits-all policy, but must tailor its policies to fit local conditions in individual countries. Washington must have a proactive strategy to counter Islamist extremism, combat terrorist groups, and offer effective measures to promote solutions for problems that contributed to the uprisings. In particular, the U.S. must offer solutions to address the single greatest challenge in the region -- poor prospects for economic growth and job creation -- the cause célèbre that was the root of much of the original impetus for the Arab uprisings. The problem right now is that the Obama Administration is woefully short on providing the right solutions.\n\nThe Obama Administration has been too quick to bestow democratic legitimacy on Islamist movements that hold non-democratic ideological agendas. The Carter Administration, which made a similar mistake in the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian revolution, was rewarded by Iranian revolutionaries with the hostage crisis. Islamist extremists who claimed to be democrats, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, have also advanced radical agendas with disastrous results after gaining power through elections.\n\nThe Obama Administration must not repeat that mistake in Egypt with the Muslim Brotherhood, which cloaks its radical long-term goals with moderate rhetoric. While the Muslim Brotherhood is willing to participate in elections to gain power, it is not clear that it would accede to the results of an election if it loses power. At the heart of its ideology lies an anti-democratic idea: that its politicized interpretation of the will of God trumps the will of the people.\n\nElections are a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for building a stable democracy. Equally important are the presence of a supportive civil society, respect for the rule of law, independent institutions, freedom of the press, political freedom, and religious freedom. These conditions are not present in many of the countries affected by the Arab uprisings, and the transition to democracy is likely to be much more difficult and take far longer than many assume in the West.\n\nIn the meantime, Washington should not confuse democracy with freedom. There have been many revolutions that claimed to be democratic and led to more repression rather than freedom, including the French, Russian, and Iranian revolutions. The United States should focus on promoting freedom rather than democracy. Not only is a political party's commitment to freedom easier to judge, both before and after it has taken power, but the drive for freedom was the original impetus for the Arab uprisings. Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire to protest the seizure of his merchandise and lack of economic freedom, was the initial inspiration for widespread protests.\n\nFirst Steps. The United States needs a comprehensive integrated strategy to deal with a truly strategic challenge. At the same time, events are moving too quickly for the U.S. to wait to act. To shape the new order emerging from the Arab uprisings, Washington should:\n\nEstablish clear red lines for new governments that spell out the criteria for continued U.S. support. Anti-American hostility is deeply embedded in the DNA of Islamist political parties. When they come to power, the U.S. should only provide support if the regimes:\n\nChange U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy. A U.S. strategy myopically focused on attrition of the leadership of al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations will not work.[22] Al-Qaeda has evolved from a tight-knit terrorist organization into a networked transnational movement dispersed in many countries. It likely will continue to become even more decentralized, given the death of bin Laden. Strong international counterterrorism cooperation is necessary to reverse its growth, mitigate the threat it poses, and eventually defeat it.\n\nWashington must place a higher priority on establishing relationships with military and intelligence officials within newly established governments, who could emerge as de facto allies against Islamist extremists. It should also offer to train, equip, and provide advisers for nascent military, intelligence, and internal security services. This would not only help in cultivating possible allies against al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremists but also would help prevent the security organs of new governments from sliding back into old habits of behavior that threaten the freedom and lives of their compatriots.\n\nPromote Economic Freedom. Political demands were central to the Arab uprisings, but economic reform is critical for shoring up political stability and facilitating sustainable political reforms. Many Arab countries adopted a socialist model for economic development in the 1950s, which curtailed economic growth, encouraged the development of swollen bureaucracies, and prompted the creation of inefficient state-owned industries. It is no coincidence that Tunisia and Egypt, the first two countries to experience the \"Arab Spring,\" had strong socialist legacies that resulted in corrosive corruption and dysfunctional bureaucracies that were perceived to oppress rather than serve citizens.\n\nWashington should encourage governments to liberalize their economies, remove bureaucratic red tape, and encourage domestic and foreign investment to spur the development of a vibrant private sector.[23] Expensive state-owned enterprises should be privatized wherever possible, in a transparent and fair process to avoid the rise of crony capitalism. Expanding the private sector will fuel economic growth, spur job creation, and help create a larger middle class, which is an important building block for developing stable democracies.\n\nWashington should encourage its Middle Eastern allies to strengthen protections for property rights and root out corruption by state authorities who seek to confiscate private property or exploit public property for their own benefit. Private enterprise, the chief engine of economic growth, cannot flourish unless entrepreneurs are free to expand their businesses without fear of government confiscation.\n\nThe United States also should encourage the negotiation of bilateral and regional free trade agreements. This would benefit Arab countries by eliminating trade barriers between them, as well as between them and the U.S. or European Union. Such agreements not only could lower the costs of imported goods but could also expand Arab exports to U.S. or European markets. In Egypt's case, if a free trade agreement with the United States seems unreachable in the short run, it should be encouraged to expand its Qualifying Industrial Zone system established jointly with Israel, which would allow it to increase exports to the United States. Such an arrangement would have the added benefit of giving the Egyptian government a greater stake in maintaining good relations with the United States and Israel.\n\nWork with Sub-State Actors in Hostile or Failing States. The Arab uprisings have greatly weakened the authority and legitimacy of central governments in many countries. There are growing swathes of ungoverned space in Libya, Mali, Syria, and Yemen, where there are no reliable state authorities that can contain or restrain Islamist extremists or terrorists. In cases where Washington lacks a government ally, it should cultivate tribal leaders, political parties, or ethnic groups that can help mitigate the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other extremists.\n\nIn Syria, Washington should increase its support of the opposition to accelerate the fall of Bashar al-Assad's hostile dictatorship: It should augment its current humanitarian aid, diplomatic support, and non-lethal technical support with enhanced financial aid and the discreet provision of arms and training to effective military commanders inside Syria who can be relied on to contain the influence of Islamist extremists and help build an inclusive pluralist Syria after the Assad regime is toppled.[24] The longer the Syrian civil war continues, the more it is likely to fuel sectarian tensions that al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremists can exploit.\n\nThe countries affected by the \"Arab Spring\" face much more difficult transitions to stable democracy than is generally recognized. Islamists have been the big winners in the political upheavals so far: They have captured the leadership of governments in Egypt and Tunisia, exert a growing influence in Libya, and play key roles in insurgencies in Mali, Syria, and Yemen. Although al-Qaeda played a small role in the initial phases of the Arab uprisings, it is now positioned to exploit the aftermath -- chaos, anarchy, and power vacuums in failed or failing states. It is in the U.S. national interest, as well as in the interests of U.S. allies and most Arabs, to prevent Islamist extremists from hijacking the unfinished revolutions and imposing totalitarian dictatorships in the affected countries. That will not happen without concerted focused leadership from Washington.\n\nProactive thoughtful engagement centered on protecting U.S. interests and promoting peace and prosperity in the region is a more cost-effective alternative to the cycle of violence and repression that is likely to emerge from the Arab uprisings if met with American indifference.","source":{"uri":"heritage.org","dataType":"news","title":"The Heritage Foundation"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.3333333333333333,"wgt":403553700,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226397962","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"18:14:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T18:14:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T16:42:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/10/15/obama-to-stump-for/","title":"Obama to stump for Democrats in three states ahead of high-stakes Nov. 8 election","body":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama will campaign for Democratic Party candidates in Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin later this month ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress.\n\nObama will stump for candidates for federal and state offices, appearing in Atlanta on Oct. 28 before traveling to Detroit and Milwaukee on Oct. 29, his office said on Saturday.\n\nRepublicans are seen winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives and possibly the U.S. Senate as well.

Os analistas de mercado e qualquer pessoa com interesse, mesmo que passageiro, por moda masculina se lembram daquele ano como o momento em que a \"suitsupply\" se tornou um fenômeno mundial. Foi também o momento em que, pela primeira vez, novas tecnologias permitiram que os homens personalizassem seus ternos online sem ter que se submeter a tremendos incômodos como visitar um alfaiate ou ir a uma loja.\n\nAcontece que 2010 também coincidiu com algumas outras mudanças na evolução da moda, e este pode ser o momento certo para apontar um fato sobre o vestuário masculino que não costuma ser muito apreciado. Em sua função de uniforme masculino, o terno mudou notavelmente pouco em 400 anos, dizem os historiadores da moda. (Aproveitando o gancho: ver Harry Styles de vestido não teria sido grande choque para os habitantes de épocas pré-industriais, nas quais homens e mulheres usavam túnicas parecidas e os filhos meninos da aristocracia costumavam usar vestidos até serem promovidos aos trajes com duas pernas, um rito de passagem conhecido como \"breeching\" [(algo como \"encalçamento\"]).\n\nEm outras palavras, embora os ternos tenham sempre estado conosco, suas proporções mudam constantemente, de acordo com o gosto de cada momento, e na segunda década deste século a influência do estilista americano Thom Browne se infiltrou em todos os quadrantes de uma indústria que vinha cambaleando e precisava de uma nova orientação. Para quem desconhece a influência de Browne, podemos resumi-la assim: Querida, ele encolheu o terno.\n\nBrowne criou paletós mais apertados e mais curtos, destacando o posterior masculino. Criou calças justíssimas e tão curtas que, de repente, era como se os homens tivessem voltado a ter tornozelos.\n\nA moda mais ampla talvez tenha evitado as manifestações mais extremas do terno encolhido, mas ainda assim recebeu a mensagem. Sujeitos de todos os tipos e dos mais variados formatos anatômicos -- de \"girafas\" a \"short kings\" [baixinhos posudos] -- adotaram os ternos justos, fizeram deles o traje padrão no mundo dos negócios, e não pareciam inclinados a abandonar a tendência. E aí, é claro, a pandemia aconteceu, e ninguém quer ler mais uma reportagem sobre o efeito que ela teve sobre as calças e blazers desconfortáveis.\n\nAgora, porém, o número de trabalhadores que estão de volta aos escritórios já é enorme. Número surpreendente de profissionais está ralando há meses, ou, nos casos de alguns bancos de investimento, há quase um ano, em seus formigueiros corporativos.\n\nEm termos de retorno ao escritório, portanto, são os manos das finanças que estão abrindo o caminho. E, para quem busca observar essas criaturas em seu habitat natural, a plataforma ideal para contemplação é o saguão do Brookfield Place, um vasto complexo de escritórios no distrito financeiro de Manhattan. Lá, o crítico de moda masculina que vos fala estacionou seu traseiro em uma cadeira em três horas de almoço da semana passada, para obter um panorama daquilo que os homens de negócios estão vestindo no escritório. As informações reunidas foram aleatórias, de certa forma, mas também surpreendentes, em todos os quesitos.\n\nLonge de se vestirem de modo muito diferente do que acontecia antes que a Covid-19 confinasse os trabalhadores à segurança de seus espaços de trabalho caseiros, os \"bros\" das finanças na verdade estão se vestindo da mesma maneira que as pessoas que tinham esse tipo de emprego se vestiam quando Barack Obama ocupava a Casa Branca. Ao contrário do ex-presidente, cujas preferências de vestuário eram muitas vezes um pouco antiquadas, os homens que vi descendo as escadas rolantes que conduzem ao Royal Bank of Canada, a empresas de serviços financeiros como a American Express ou ao escritório de advocacia Jones Day, ou comprando baguetes de presunto no Le District para almoçar em suas mesas nas sedes de gigantes financeiros como o banco Goldman Sachs, pareciam bem atualizados. Isto é, atualizados com a moda de 2010.\n\n\"O que estou vestindo?\", disse David, 30, que trabalha no Goldman Sachs mas, como muitos dos entrevistados para este artigo, mencionou normas da empresa para se recusar a fornecer seu sobrenome. \"Quem quer saber?\"\n\nNa verdade, o modo de vestir de David poderia servir de modelo para cada \"bro\" das finanças que está oficialmente de volta ao escritório (\"e desta vez não vamos voltar atrás\", dizem seus chefes). David Solomon, o presidente-executivo do Goldman Sachs, é opositor ferrenho da tendência ao trabalho híbrido e declarou repetidamente que vê o trabalho remoto como aberração, e quer que seus funcionários retornem ao escritório em período integral.\n\nComo quase todas as pessoas entrevistadas, ou mesmo vistas de relance, em Brookfield Place, David vestia uma camisa branca muito bem passada, sem gravata. O modelo que ele ostentava era uma camisa Leeward da Mizzen+Main, que custa US$ 99 (R$ 526). A peça se amoldava bem ao seu torso musculoso. O mesmo pode ser sito sobre suas calças New Venture de poliéster e \"elastomultiester\", com bolsos externos, da linha casual de negócios Lululemon, à venda por US$ 148 (R$ 787). Seus sapatos Bruno Magli, de amarrar e no tradicional estilo Oxford, eram pretos.\n\nNo contexto, aquilo era quase um gesto punk, se considerarmos que, por razões desconhecidas, muitos dos consumidores do mundo dos negócios parecem ter sido persuadidos a comprar sapatos em um tom marrom claro evocativo de um bronzeado por spray comprado com desconto. Que os fabricantes de sapatos escureçam artificialmente as biqueiras para dar um ar envelhecido a esses calçados certamente não ajuda muito.\n\n\"As roupas que usamos são um pouco mais informais, agora\", disse David, do Goldman Sachs, ecoando um refrão muito repetido. Menos formal, no contexto, significa não usar gravata, exceto para reuniões com clientes.\n\nÉ verdade que houve gente que ia ao escritório de calção e chinelo de dedo na época em que os locais de trabalho estavam desertos, mas mesmo assim alguns funcionários intrépidos insistiam em trabalhar nas sedes completamente vazias de suas empresas. Em bancos como o Goldman Sachs e o JPMorgan Chase, dizem pessoas bem informadas, executivos de alto nível continuam a se apegar alguns costumes da era da pandemia, como indicadores de seu status elevado. \"Blazers de cashmere sem forro, jeans escuros e [sapatos] Allbirds são vetores simbólicos de senioridade\", disse um financista de um banco de investimento de primeira linha na semana passada.\n\nHouve um período em que \"você podia usar jeans em uma sexta-feira\", disse Arjun Menon, 33, do Goldman Sachs. Menon rapidamente acrescentou que não tinha permissão para falar com a imprensa, embora não antes de revelar que as calças azul marinho com bolsos externos, que ele usava em companhia de uma camisa de colarinho aberto branca muito bem passada e um par de Oxfords de amarrar -que estão para os sapatos como uma balada de Michael Bublé está para a música- foram comprados na Suitsupply.\n\nCom base nas provas disponíveis, Suitsupply, Lululemon, Club Monaco e Brooks Brothers (embora não a linha revitalizada e consciente das novas tendências que esta última grife adotou sob a direção criativa de Michael Bastian) continuam sendo as marcas preferenciais de muitos executivos. Isto se aplica especialmente ao pessoal das mesas de operações, sujeitos recém-egressos de programas de MBA que ainda não deixaram sua marca e não estão esgotados a ponto de sonhar de olhos abertos com uma oportunidade de tacar fogo em seus agasalhos com logotipos da empresa.\n\n(As coisas são diferentes, explicou uma pessoa bem informada, para os especialistas do setor de tecnologia. Aparecer de terno para uma reunião com clientes no Vale do Silício, onde usar meias engraçadinhas continua a ser tendência, \"pareceria completamente estranho\", ele disse.)\n\nQuanto aos calçados, os produtos preferidos tendem a ser modelos de preço médio de marcas como Johnston & Murphy, To Boot e Allen Edmonds, uma fabricante de calçados de Wisconsin fundada para fornecer calçados a soldados na Segunda Guerra Mundial. Embora não houvesse muitos calçados de luxo em uso entre os homens de Brookfield Place -o shopping center instalado no saguão, decorado por palmeiras, tem como âncora butiques reluzentes que vendem Bottega Veneta, Louis Vuitton, Ferragamo e Gucci -- , isso talvez se deva à queda dos mercados.\n\n\"Talvez, se recebermos uma bonificação, eu compre algum Gucci\", disse Charles Li, 26, funcionário do Scotiabank. Li estava vestindo roupas básicas mas de corte elegante (calças azuis, camisa branca, Oxfords), da Suitsupply, cuja loja no Brookfield Place fica convenientemente localizada no nível do mezanino. Um colega de Li, Allan Bossard, 23, usava praticamente a mesma roupa.\n\n\"Claro, eu me importo com roupas\", disse Bossard. Mas, ele acrescentou, isso não é mais ou menos verdade agora do que era antes do início dos lockdowns, em 2020. \"É importante estar apresentável no escritório, porque, afinal, você representa a firma\".\n\nPara Ryan Meiser, 31, analista de investimentos do Royal Bank of Canada, a fase de retorno ao escritório não sinalizou grande mudança em sua rotina matutina. \"Você precisa ter personalidade para se vestir\", disse Meiser, que usava uma camisa branca Giorgio Armani, um par de calças Zegna cinza e sapatos de um fabricante cujo nome ele havia esquecido.\n\nMas no final, aquilo que uma pessoa escolhe vestir no escritório pode ser uma pergunta menos relevante do que determinar onde exatamente fica seu local de trabalho. \"Ir três dias por semana ao escritório é obrigatório, com a segunda e sexta-feira como opcionais\", disse Meiser.\n\n\"Nos finais de semana\", ele acrescentou com uma risada, \"estamos livres para trabalhar em casa\".","source":{"uri":"f5.folha.uol.com.br","dataType":"news","title":"F5"},"authors":[],"image":"https://f.i.uol.com.br/fotografia/2022/10/13/1665688807634864e714e1a_1665688807_3x2_rt.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":null,"wgt":403553100,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226385782","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"17:56:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T17:56:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T17:56:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.729411780834198,"url":"https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2022/10/15/barack-obama-campaign-stacey-abrams-georgia-governors-race/","title":"Barack Obama to campaign for Stacey Abrams in Georgia governor's race","body":"ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Stacey Abrams is bringing in arguably the biggest name in the Democratic Party as the nation's most watched governor's race enters its final weeks.\n\nOn Saturday, the Georgia Democratic Party announced former President Barack Obama will appear in Atlanta on Oct. 28 to campaign for Abrams, who is hoping to unseat Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on Nov. 8.\n\nAbrams and Gov. Brian Kemp are set to face each other Monday in the first of two debates. Abrams is hoping to become the nation's first Black female governor in U.S. history, while Obama - the nation's first African American president - remains one of the Democratic Party's most beloved figures.\n\nOn Friday, First Lady Jill Biden appeared with Abrams at a private campaign event in Atlanta.\n\nOn Saturday, Citizens for a Greater Georgia and the Atlanta Young Republicans hosted a day of action in support of Kemp, Insurance Commissioner John King and Liz Hausmann's state Senate district 14 campaign. Former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler joined the candidates in canvassing nearby neighborhoods.\n\nThis year's race is a rematch of their epic 2018 race, in which they both sought the governor's mansion, as then-Gov. Nathan Deal was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a third term. Kemp was then secretary of state, while Abrams had just finished up a term as a state House representative from intown Atlanta.\n\nFull coverage of Georgia's 2022 midterms\n\nBut this year's rematch is much different from their 2018 encounter. Kemp now has a four-year record as governor of mostly popular conservative philosophies; oversees a strong state economy; and seems to have weathered a blistering attack from former President Donald Trump for not overturning the outcome of state's 2020 presidential election.\n\nAbrams narrowly lost that election to Kemp in a contest she has yet to concede.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, has been out of office since 2017 and is consistently trailing in the polls, the most recent coming Wednesday that showed Abrams trailing Kemp by 10 points.\n\nLast week, Abrams reported her campaign has raised more than $36 million over a three-month period, and has more than $11 million cash on hand. Also last week, Kemp's re-election campaign reported having raised almost $29 million over the latest, third-quarter fundraising period.\n\nEarly voting begins Monday in all of Georgia's 2022 midterm elections.\n\nState law requires local elections officials to allow early in-person voting beginning on the fourth Monday prior to a primary or election, and as soon as possible prior to the runoff.\n\nEarly voting ends on the Friday immediately prior to Election Day which, this year, is Nov. 8.\n\nEarly voting takes place Monday through Friday, and the second and third Saturdays before Election Day. Some polling locations may be open on the second and third Sundays. The Georgia Secretary of State's office advises to be sure and verify available dates and polling hours with your early voting precinct.\n\nDates, deadlines to remember for Georgia's 2022 elections\n\nDuring early voting, polls are typically open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays.

More often than not, idealistic young people find themselves drawn to the Democratic Party over euphemistic ideals and clichés that have become associated with the Democrats.\n\nThe problem is that, upon close inspection, these clichés are completely false. Here are just a few of them.\n\nIt's hard to say how exactly this cliché started. Americans have certainly been wary about getting involved in armed conflict since the Vietnam War, but how Democrats emerged as the so-called anti-war party doesn't quite compute. For one thing, it was Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson who got us involved in Vietnam, and it was ultimately Republican Richard Nixon who got us out. My first real experience observing an anti-war movement was the anti-Iraq War movement that started in 2002, and, looking back on every armed conflict since, a pattern emerges: wars that Democrats start are okay.\n\nIt's true. While the justification for going to war with Iraq in 2002 can be debated, and plenty of Democrats supported it at the time, generally speaking, Democrats would eventually brand themselves the anti-war party when it became fashionable to do so. I've long attributed this to the meteoric rise of then-governor of Vermont Howard Dean's presidential candidacy. Democrats ultimately chose Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) as their nominee, mostly due to perceptions of electability, because he branded himself a war hero who was also anti-war (despite his vote supporting the war in Iraq).\n\nThe pro-war/anti-war dichotomy worked extremely well for Barack Obama in 2008, and he was elected despite being completely unqualified for the job. In fact, anti-war sentiment was so strong that Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize even though he had done nothing to actually earn it. Despite running as an anti-war candidate, he not only failed to end the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, but he started more than one unnecessary war, launching airstrikes in five other countries as well.\n\nHe prematurely declared the end of the war in Iraq in 2011, but his toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya also destabilized the region, leading to the rise of ISIS, which resulted in Obama sending more troops back to Iraq to address it. None of Obama's hawkish actions generated any sort of mass protests from the left though, because wars started by Democrats are okay. The fact that Trump was the first president in forty years not to start a new war is a detail that has been brushed under the rug.\n\nThis was perhaps the most prevalent cliché I remember from my youth: \"Republicans are for the rich, and Democrats are for the poor.\" Frankly, you still hear it today, and Democrats themselves perpetuate this myth with constant appeals about the rich \"paying their fair share\" and bemoaning Republicans' so-called \"tax cuts for the rich.\" These lines have been used often and instinctually by the left for decades. Of course, it doesn't reflect reality. For example, Donald Trump's tax cuts, which were, of course, decried as tax cuts for the rich, actually benefited the middle class; meanwhile, Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan actually increased taxes on the middle class -- proving again that Democrats' advocacy for average Americans is an illusion.\n\nThis is an easy one. For all their virtue-signaling about the environment and being green, it sure takes an awful lot of private jets to send Democrats around the world to push these green policies. It's true that Democrats are strong advocates of alternative energy and green this and that, but that has nothing to do with the environment as much as it has to do with who funds their campaigns. It's no coincidence that the biggest beneficiaries of Obama's green energy loan program, which was a total bust, went to companies that donated to his campaign.\n\nYou've heard this all your life, I'm sure: Democrats are tolerant, and Republicans are racist. This stereotype is reinforced in pop culture, and Democrats use it to their advantage in every possible way. In fact, because of it, many people don't realize that it was the Republican Party that ended slavery and was pro-civil rights, while the Democratic Party was pro-slavery and anti-civil rights. You'll hear some on the left pretend this wasn't true or perpetuate the myth of \"the big switch\" where the GOP and Democratic Party switched platforms.\n\nToday's Democratic Party sure does pander to minorities, but what exactly have they done for them? Very little, clearly, and their big problem is that minorities are starting to notice that Democrats are all talk and are slowly but surely shifting to the Republican Party.\n\nIt is a complete misnomer to call Democrats \"pro-choice\" just because they support abortion rights. For some time now, I've described them as \"pro-abortion\" because it's far more accurate. Democrats have long opposed anything that might help a woman decide against having an abortion, like ultrasound requirements. Many on the left see little difference between choosing life and being anti-abortion.\n\nThe fact is that, right now, pregnancy centers that don't offer abortions have come under assault by the left, the Biden administration is actively targeting pro-life activists, and attacks on pro-life groups and centers have gone unpunished by the Biden administration as well. If Democrats were truly pro-choice, they'd consider the choice not to have an abortion as valid as the choice to have one, but in the end, what really matters is abortion industry profits -- the more money they bring in, the more Democrats receive in donations.

For years he questioned Obama's citizenship, then had the nerve to try to lure away his voters.\n\n\"Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from Democratic control,\" Trump said at a campaign rally in 2016. \"To those I say the following: What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose?\"\n\nThat was almost as bad as his quote four years later, in the wake of racial upheaval over the police brutality death of George Floyd.\n\n\"I say very modestly, I have done more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president,\" Trump said in 2020.\n\nOK. You can stop laughing now.\n\nYes, Biden outperformed Obama among Black voters in some districts, but you don't see Obama out there crying about his legacy.\n\nHe knows that the Black population grew between 2008 and 2020, increasing Biden's pool of African-American voters.\n\nHe also knows that as important as it was for Black people to put Obama in the White House, it was even more important to get Trump out.","source":{"uri":"nydailynews.com","dataType":"news","title":"Daily News"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/2mLd1gNkgLUOKi7s4M1d3Gz5jpg=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/3MZAXMHI3FBPBKD3EFEYMLEF44.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.4274509803921569,"wgt":403552500,"relevance":9},{"uri":"7226381990","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"17:50:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T17:50:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T16:42:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.rawstory.com/obama-to-stump-for-democrats-in-three-states-ahead-of-high-stakes-nov-8-election/","title":"Obama to stump for Democrats in three states ahead of high-stakes Nov. 8 election","body":"Former U.S. President Barack Obama will campaign for Democratic Party candidates in Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin later this month ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress.\n\nObama will stump for candidates for federal and state offices, appearing in Atlanta on Oct. 28 before traveling to Detroit and Milwaukee on Oct. 29, his office said on Saturday.\n\nRepublicans are seen winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives and possibly the U.S. Senate as well.

Andersen vidste, at ordene var ildeset. Men talestrÃ¸mmen fra landsmÃ¸descenen fortsatte.\n\n- Vi har taget livet af bÃ¸rnene. Det er derfor, vi mangler arbejdskraft i Danmark, rÃ¥bte Verner B. Andersen ud over de cirka 150 partifÃ|ller i salen:\n\n- Jeg ved godt, du (den presse- og strategiansvarlige, red.) ikke er for, at vi skal sige det. Men det er bare sÃ¥dan, det er, kÃ|re venner.\n\nSÃ¥ledes takkede Verner B. Andersen for taletiden og forlod scenen til bifald fra sine partifÃ|ller.\n\nPÃ¥ bare to minutter var det lykkedes ham at ribbe op i en diskussion, som partiet i Ã¥revis har forsÃ¸gt lÃ|gge lÃ¥g pÃ¥.\n\nKristendemokraterne blev skabt som et kristent protestparti i 1970 og var en direkte konsekvens af diskussionen om retten til fri abort.\n\nI partiets principprogram fra 2008 stÃ¥r, at \"loven om fri abort er principielt uacceptabel\". Og da partiets tidligere formand, Stig Grenov, i 2019 var pÃ¥ orlov, gik han til tasterne pÃ¥ Twitter og skrev:\n\n- Det er, som om alle kvinder skal have en abort for at vÃ|re moderne og frigjort.\n\nSiden er den officielle linje dog blÃ¸dt op. Blandt andet da Jens Rohde i april 2021 meldte sig ind i partiet og dermed blev dets eneste reprÃ|sentant i Folketinget.\n\nRohde gjorde det i den forbindelse klart, at han var fuldtonet tilhÃ|nger af den frie abort og ikke var til at rokke.\n\nDa partiet, som dengang havde Isabella Arendt i spidsen, kort tid efter fremlagde en 2030-plan, var det derfor med en omskrivning af abortpolitikken.\n\nNu ville Kristendemokraterne ikke lÃ|ngere arbejde for at afskaffe retten til fri abort, men kÃ|mpe for at fÃ¥ nedbragt antallet.\n\nDet har dog langt fra fÃ¥et abortdebatten til at forstumme.\n\nDer findes ikke et eneste interview med partiets fungerende formand, Marianne Karlsmose, hvor hun ikke er blevet spurgt, om hun stÃ¸tter retten til fri abort. Det pÃ¥stod i hvert fald flere af de medlemmer, som TV 2 talte med under landsmÃ¸det lÃ¸rdag.\n\nDerfor blev flere medlemmer da ogsÃ¥ tydeligt frustrerede, da TV 2s reporter gjorde det samme.\n\nDet er \"Ã|rgerligt\", lÃ¸d det fra medlem Steen Davidsen, at medierne bliver ved med at \"kÃ¸re rundt i\" abortpolitikken:\n\n- Det er som om, medierne ikke vil slippe det.\n\nFolketingskandidat og hovedbestyrelsesformand Inge Jensen tilsluttede sig koret. Kristendemokraterne vil \"snart gerne spÃ¸rges om noget andet,\" sagde hun til TV 2.\n\n- Jeg vil nÃ|sten kalde det sjofelt, at man spÃ¸rger os om ting, som ingen andre partier bliver spurgt om.\n\nMen det var fÃ¸r, der blev Ã¥bnet for mikrofonen pÃ¥ landsmÃ¸descenen.\n\nSelvom der undervejs blev sendt flere stikpiller afsted til medierne om, at \"journalisterne stadig ikke har forstÃ¥et, hvad KD stÃ¥r for,\" benyttede flere medlemmer muligheden for at understrege, at de altsÃ¥ stÃ¸tter partiet nye linje.\n\nMan kunne derfor ogsÃ¥ nÃ|sten fÃ¥ indtrykket af en strÃ¸mlinet politisk linje.\n\nMen sÃ¥ kom altsÃ¥ Verner B. Andersen.\n\n- Kristendemokraterne har et fantastisk menneskesyn. Vi betragter alle mennesker lige, fordi de har fÃ¥et livet, sagde han og tilfÃ¸jede, at alle ifÃ¸lge ham burde se sÃ¥dan pÃ¥ livet:\n\n- Det er vigtigt, at det menneskesyn kommer ud, for det kan alle identificere sig med. Alle er lige, fordi vi har fÃ¥et livet. DesvÃ|rre mangler vi mange hundrede tusinde, som aldrig fik livet. Vi mangler arbejdskraft i Danmark... Det tror da skam, nÃ¥r vi har taget livet af bÃ¸rnene. Men det mÃ¥ vi ikke sige. SÃ¥ dÃ¥rlige mÃ¥ vi ikke vÃ|re.\n\nEfterfÃ¸lgende henvendte TV 2s journalist sig igen til folketingskandidat Inge Jensen, som fra landsmÃ¸dets start kritiserede medierne for at fastholde et uberettiget fokus pÃ¥ abort.\n\nNu har flere af dine partifÃ|ller helt selv og uden journalisters spÃ¸rgsmÃ¥l brugt tid pÃ¥ at tale om abort. Mener du stadig, at det er \"sjofelt\" af journalister at spÃ¸rge om det?\n\n- Hvor mange var det lige? Har du statistik pÃ¥ det?, spurgte Inge Jensen.\n\nNej, men jeg bemÃ|rkede, at flere havde behov for at bekrÃ|fte, at de stÃ¸ttede retten til abort i de fÃ¸rste 12 uger, mens Verner B. Andersen altsÃ¥ var noget mere kritisk. SÃ¥ er det ikke naturligt nok, at jeg gerne vil spÃ¸rge om netop abort?\n\n- Der er ingenting, vi ikke vil tale om i Kristendemokraterne. Det er ikke ligesom Mette Frederiksen, som siger, at abort slet ikke er noget at tale om, sagde Inge Jensen.\n\nPartifÃ|llen Ester Esmarch, kandidat i Sydjylland, brÃ¸d ind:\n\n- Det er jo censur.\n\nKristendemokraterne blev senest valgt til Folketinget i 2001, men var i 2019 nervepirrende tÃ|t pÃ¥ et comeback.\n\nFor fÃ¸rste gang siden 2005 fik det 52-Ã¥rige parti over 1 procent af stemmerne og var blot 0,3 procentpoint fra spÃ|rregrÃ|nsen. En fremgang, som davÃ|rende formand Isabella Arendt fik store dele af Ã|ren for.\n\nArendt har dog siden forladt partiet til fordel for Det Konservative Folkeparti, og selvom det kostede pÃ¥ medlemskontoen, er der fortsat optimisme at spore blandt de cirka 150 medlemmer, der havde indfundet sig i Kolding.\n\nGanske fÃ¥ minutter inde i landsmÃ¸det stod det nemlig klart, at de var der for at tale om tro.\n\nIkke troen pÃ¥ Gud, nÃ¸dvendigvis. Nej, fÃ|lles for dem alle var troen pÃ¥, at partiet efter 1. november atter er reprÃ|senteret i Folketinget.\n\nâ€I kan ikke slÃ¥ os ihjelâ€, citerede et medlem christianitternes nationalsang. â€Iâ€™m still standing,â€ citerede en anden Elton John, mens en tredje havde taget et Barack Obama-citat med til lejligheden:","source":{"uri":"nyheder.tv2.dk","dataType":"news","title":"nyheder.tv2.dk"},"authors":[],"image":"https://cdn-free.tv2i.dk/e/d/i/editorial/9/d/8/9d8dac52-6dff-46c4-958a-fcd191d88bbe?ixlib=js-3.2.1&w=1280&h=720&q=60&auto=format&fit=crop&rect64=MjIyLDEwNywxNDA4LDc5NQ&s=00b3c914c2da29d54f532d8321b84647","eventUri":null,"sentiment":null,"wgt":403551900,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226375087","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"17:41:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T17:41:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T17:41:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-us-president-obama-to-stump-for-democrats-in-three-states-ahead/","title":"Former U.S. President Obama to stump for Democrats in three states ahead of high-stakes Nov. 8 election","body":"Former U.S. President Barack Obama will campaign for Democratic Party candidates in Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin later this month ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress.\n\nObama will stump for candidates for federal and state offices, appearing in Atlanta on Oct. 28 before travelling to Detroit and Milwaukee on Oct. 29, his office said on Saturday.\n\nRepublicans are seen winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives and possibly the U.S. Senate as well.

He did not win Georgia in either presidential campaign, but now-President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\n\"Given the high stakes of this year's midterm elections, President Obama wants to do his part to help Democrats win next month,\" the spokesperson said. \"This is why he headlined four finance events in recent months for the key campaign committees and will campaign in targeted states as part of Democrats' final GOTV stretch. He looks forward to stumping for candidates up and down the ballot, especially in races and states that will have consequences for the administration of 2024 elections.\"\n\nThe former President headlined a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee on August 31, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on September 8, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on September 28, and the Democratic National Committee on September 29.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The contractor hired by Florida later extended the window for the trips until Dec. 1, according to memos released by the state Department of Transportation.\n\nVertol Systems Company of Destin, Florida, was hired to organize the flights and sent an employee to the state capital of Tallahassee to pick up a hard copy of a $950,000 check after the state didn't receive paperwork for a direct deposit to the company's account, according to the documents.\n\nVertol owner James Montgomerie didn't answer a phone call and email seeking comments about the flight plans.

DeSantis has said that the migrants intention was to come to Florida.\n\nThe documents released Friday gave no details of how migrants were recruited in San Antonio for the Martha Vineyard flights nor who was hired to conduct that part of the operation.\n\nAlso Friday, A Texas sheriff certified that the 49 migrants flown Martha's Vineyard last month to be crime victims, a move that allows them to apply for special visas to remain in the United States. The sheriff said an investigation has been opened.\n\nThe Martha's Vineyard flight has also spawned lawsuits accusing Florida of lying to the migrants to get them to agree to the flights.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Komen became such a recognized name in breast cancer awareness | News Channel 3-12","body":"Susan G. Komen is one of the largest, most recognized breast cancer organizations in the world. Since its founding in 1982, the nonprofit has invested more than $1 billion in cancer research, and more than $2 billion in patient outreach, according to financial documents. The foundation's Race for the Cure is known as the one of the largest breast cancer awareness events created, and is as synonymous with the cause as the iconic pink ribbon.\n\nYet, the actual Susan G. Komen was not a celebrity. She did not publicize her illness, which took her life in 1980 at the age of 36. In fact, it was only after Komen's death that her name became so incredibly famous.\n\nSusan G. Komen was born Susan Goodman, and grew up in Peoria, Illinois. According to her sister, Nancy Goodman Brinker, she was well-liked; a homecoming queen and caring older sister. When Komen was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33, she and her family went through all of the terror and uncertainty one does when faced with a life-threatening disease. Despite undergoing various treatment strategies, Komen died three years later.\n\nIt was Nancy Brinker who founded the organization in Komen's honor. Brinker, who was married to restaurant magnate Norman Brinker until 2000, would go on to become the World Health Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for Cancer Control. She was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nIn 1983, Brinker had the idea to capitalize on the jogging fad and hold a 5K race in Dallas as a fundraising event. The result was the first ever Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. The idea ballooned from there, becoming a multi-city event within years. This level of marketing savvy was one of the reasons the foundation got so popular so quickly. The pageantry of the races, with survivors and supporters decked out in pink, carrying signs and cheering each other on along the way, became an iconic part of the breast cancer awareness movement.\n\nBrinker's charity efforts were also buoyed by a rising tide of breast cancer awareness in the 1980s. First lady Betty Ford, wife of President Gerald Ford, prompted an increase in mammograms back in 1974 after she announced she had breast cancer. Brinker herself was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984.\n\nSusan G. Komen continued to harness the momentum of breast cancer awareness into the 1990s, as the popularity of the ubiquitous pink ribbon also rose and more companies began creating breast cancer awareness tie-ins. By its 20th anniversary in 2002, the foundation had raised more than $400 million and amassed powerful corporate partners.\n\nHowever, the foundation has also been beset by controversy. In 2012, Susan G. Komen halted funding for screening exams for Planned Parenthood, a move many saw as a politicization of the cause. Though the decision was reversed, it caused the resignation of several staff members and damaged public perception. Around the same time, Brinker -- who stepped down as CEO -- was criticized for the large six-figure salary she was collecting as CEO of the foundation. In 2016, the foundation received more criticism after holding an annual fundraiser at then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nSince these events, the organization has struggled with wavering levels of public trust, even seeing a decline in fundraising in recent years.\n\nDespite controversy, Komen's Race for the Cure walks and runs continue to be wildly popular. This year, 40 cities across the US will host More Than Pink Walk and Race for the Cure events. And while not every pink ribbon or breast cancer walk is related to Susan G. Komen, the foundation's influence is hard to overlook.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Several Republicans who want to upend the way votes are cast and counted are also running for top election administrator offices in their states.\n\nObama will tell voters that Democrats are the party for protecting abortion rights but a main theme in his appearances will also be that Democrats can be better trusted to keep elections fair, with the next presidential contest slated for 2024.\n\n\"He looks forward to stumping for candidates up and down the ballot, especially in races and states that will have consequences for the administration of 2024 elections,\" Obama's office said in a statement.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a Republican, is also holding campaign events to support Republicans, with the rallies featuring speeches in which he has repeatedly hinted he might run for president again in 2024.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that he lost the 2020 presidential contest to Democrat Joe Biden because of fraud.\n\nRepublicans who back Trump's false claim have become their party's nominees for top election officials in states that could play decisive roles in the 2024 contest.\n\nRepublicans Jim Marchant of Nevada and Mark Finchem of Arizona, for example, want to curtail or abolish early voting, mail-in voting and ballot drop-boxes, claiming without evidence that they breed fraud.\n\nVoting groups are concerned that the election of some far right candidates could threaten the integrity of the next presidential election.

Several Republicans who want to upend the way votes are cast and counted are also running for top election administrator offices in their states.\n\nObama will tell voters that Democrats are the party for protecting abortion rights but a main theme in his appearances will also be that Democrats can be better trusted to keep elections fair, with the next presidential contest slated for 2024.\n\n\"He looks forward to stumping for candidates up and down the ballot, especially in races and states that will have consequences for the administration of 2024 elections,\" Obama's office said in a statement.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a Republican, is also holding campaign events to support Republicans, with the rallies featuring speeches in which he has repeatedly hinted he might run for president again in 2024.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that he lost the 2020 presidential contest to Democrat Joe Biden because of fraud.\n\nRepublicans who back Trump's false claim have become their party's nominees for top election officials in states that could play decisive roles in the 2024 contest.\n\nRepublicans Jim Marchant of Nevada and Mark Finchem of Arizona, for example, want to curtail or abolish early voting, mail-in voting and ballot drop-boxes, claiming without evidence that they breed fraud.\n\nVoting groups are concerned that the election of some far right candidates could threaten the integrity of the next presidential election.

MSNBC UP NEXT\n\nIn May Fetterman, who has served as lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania since 2019, was hospitalized after suffering a stroke in May.\n\nLoad Error\n\nIn a statement Fetterman said: \"I had a stroke that was caused by a clot from my heart being in an A-fib rhythm for too long.\n\n\"The good news is I'm feeling much better, and the doctors tell me I didn't suffer any cognitive damage.\"\n\nOn Tuesday NBC News broadcast an interview with Fetterman, during which he used \"closed-captioning technology\" to read questions as they were being asked out loud by the presenter.\n\nHowever, NBC reporter Dasha Burns said: \"In small talk before the interview without captioning, it wasn't clear he was understanding our conversation.\"\n\nRadio host and writer Mark Davis described the performance as \"completely disqualifying\" for Fetterman on Twitter.\n\nHe added: \"We should all pray for his complete recovery, but the notion of electing a US Senator who cannot process words is simply unsustainable.\"\n\nFetterman discussed his health and campaign in a new election ad that began broadcasting on Saturday.\n\nHe said: \"After my stroke, I was just grateful to see Gisele and our kids. Across Pennsylvania, I keep seeing families that don't have enough time to focus on each other. They're struggling, left behind.\n\n\"We've got to make it easier for people to spend time with those they love. Politicians spend so much time fighting about the things that don't matter. I'll always be focused on what does; access to health care, lower costs, good jobs, more time with those we love.\"\n\nExplaining the rational behind the ad Brendan McPhillips, Fetterman's campaign chief, said: \"We actually want voters to get to know our candidate.\n\n\"We wanted voters to see who John is, what he stands for, and how personal this fight for families is to him.\"\n\nFetterman is in a tight battle against Trump backed Republican Mehmet Oz, better known as Dr Oz.\n\nIn August Rachel Tripp, a senior communications advisor to Oz, appeared to mock Fetterman's health telling Insider if the Democratic candidate \"had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn't have had a major stroke and wouldn't be in the position of having to lie about it constantly.\"\n\nOz later told NBC News' Dasha Burns that \"people with disabilities can serve and they should serve,\" but urged greater transparency, including the release of Fetterman's medical records.\n\nA poll conducted by Fox News between September 22 and 26 gave Fetterman a four-point lead, down from 11 points in July.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the Pod Save America podcast former President Barack Obama praised Fetterman for his authenticity.\n\nHe said: \"The thing I love about Fetterman, and you see it in a lot of our other candidates, is you feel as if when you're talking to them that you're having a normal conversation and they have some sense of how the rest of America lives.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMehmet Oz Admits John Fetterman's Health Shouldn't Stop Him From RunningDr. Oz's Strategy Against John Fetterman Is WorkingObama Praises Fetterman's Authenticity, Which 'Doesn't Always Apply' to GOP\n\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.","source":{"uri":"msn.com","dataType":"news","title":"MSN International Edition"},"authors":[],"image":"https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA12ZOdo.img?h=630&w=1200&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&f=jpg&x=404&y=182","eventUri":"eng-8104369","sentiment":-0.2784313725490196,"wgt":403550700,"relevance":1},{"uri":"7226364025","lang":"spa","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2022-10-15","time":"17:25:00","dateTime":"2022-10-15T17:25:00Z","dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T16:30:00Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.cubanet.org/noticias/presentaran-en-nueva-york-exposicion-sobre-arte-cubano-contemporaneo/","title":"Presentarán en Nueva York exposición sobre Arte Cubano Contemporáneo","body":"MIAMI, Estados Unidos. -- Del 21 de octubre de 2022 al 15 de enero de 2023 la galería Arte Wallach de la Universidad de Columbia acogerá la exposición Sin Autorización: Arte Cubano Contemporáneo, un acercamiento al contexto político e intelectual independiente en la Isla durante el segundo mandato del expresidente de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama.\n\nLa presentación, curada por el artista independiente cubano Abel González Fernández y por Gwen Unger, aspirante a doctora por el departamento Historia del Arte y Arqueología de la Universidad de Colombia, refleja en su obras el compromiso político y las nuevas formas de hacer de los creadores de la Isla en un contexto como el del llamado deshielo, marcado por la aparición de nuevos espacios y prácticas expositivas \"underground\", así como del auge del turismo y del interés extranjero por el arte cubano.\n\nSin Autorización: Arte Cubano Contemporáneo presenta obras que reflejan \"el rico potencial de la vasta red de lazos y conexiones personales que alimenta la comunidad artística cubana.

Many of these negative ads are misleading, and often distort or take out of context comments, actions or positions taken by a particular candidate. Worst of all, they leave voters exhausted and disillusioned with their choices, which, as politics columnist Dan Sewell said, can leave them \"holding their noses when they cast their ballots.\"\n\nIn these polarizing times, it's important to take a step back and clear the negativity from the air. To remind ourselves that just because candidates might be on opposite sides of an issue and of a different party, they are still human beings and not the embodiment of everything evil in world, as our tribal politics would sometimes have us believe.\n\nRed and blue America don't trust each other. And that's driving us dangerously apart.\n\nTo me, one of the greatest moments of statesmanship in the past 20 years came in 2008 when Republican presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John McCain defended his Democratic opponent and then-Sen. Barack Obama from an untruth during a town hall event in Lakeville, Minnesota. A constituent stood up and told McCain that she couldn't trust Obama and called him \"an Arab,\" playing into the conspiracy movement of the time which claimed Obama was not a natural-born American citizen. But McCain rejected the woman's attack on his opponent outright.\n\n\"No ma'am, he's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about,\" McCain said to applause.\n\nI wanted to find out if Greater Cincinnati politicians could play nice in the sandbox, as McCain did. If I asked those running for federal, state and local offices to say something nice or positive about their opponents, what might they say? Would they say anything at all?\n\nSo I called, emailed and texted as many candidates as I could, especially those in heated and contentious races, to get their responses. No one had a McCain moment, but all offered something positive about their opponents. The niceties came easier to some candidates than others, and most kept their responses brief. If there was an overriding theme, it was each candidate's respect for their opponent's commitment to family while also trying to serve their community/country.\n\nThere was no shortage of barbs and sharp attacks lobbed during the first public debate between Democrat Tim Ryan and Republican J.D. Vance on Monday. The two are locked in a hotly contested race for U.S. Senate that polls show is neck-and-neck as early voting begins. And while voters didn't get to hear it from the debate podium, the two men said they respect each other's commitment to family and service.\n\n\"I admire Tim Ryan's commitment to his family. It's clear that he always puts his wife and kids first,\" Vance said.\n\nDespite referring to Vance as an \"a-- kisser\" of former President Donald Trump multiple times during the debate, Ryan said he was \"grateful for J.D.'s service to our country as a U.S. Marine.\"\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine and former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley have proven they can be collegial, as the two worked together in the aftermath of a tragic mass shooting in Dayton in 2019 that left 10 people dead. While locked in a battle to be the state's next governor, Whaley said she appreciates DeWine as a family man.\n\n\"Governor DeWine cares deeply about his family and has always put them first,\" she said.\n\nCovering disabled people: Fetterman's accommodation request revealed the bias we still have against disabled people\n\nDeWine highlighted his interactions with Whaley during the COVID-19 pandemic, and her care for those she served while mayor.\n\n\"During the pandemic, when I held press conferences, which were often daily, I would call all of Ohio's big city mayors, including Mayor Whaley. I found that Mayor Whaley was concerned about people's lives and wellbeing,\" DeWine said. \"She was very candid in describing what she needed from us, and we always tried to deliver on that for her.\"\n\nIn the race for Ohio's 1st Congressional District seat, Republican Congressman Steve Chabot has developed somewhat of a reputation for negative campaigning. His opponent, Democrat Greg Landsman, has been on the receiving end of more than a few commercials painting him as a corrupt extremist who is anti-police and a tax-and-spend puppet of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDo we live in two Americas? Voters reward GOP for economics, but culture wars pull us apart.\n\nBeing characterized that way probably hasn't engendered many warm feelings toward Chabot. Still, Landsman offered this: \"I know firsthand how hard it can be to raise a family and serve in public life. While we disagree on many issues, the Congressman has managed to balance a public career with raising his family. That merits respect.\"\n\nGot any other good things to say about your opponent, Mr. Landsman?\n\n\"We're both bald,\" he quipped.\n\nAside from being follicly challenged family men, Chabot shared something else he has in common with Landsman.\n\n\"I respect that Mr. Landsman was a teacher. As a former teacher myself, I know both how demanding and how important that job can be. So, he, and all our dedicated teachers, deserve our gratitude for the time and hard work they've committed to our nation's children.\"\n\nCandidates in county races were more amenable to saying something positive about their opponent (local races tend to not be as contentious as national ones), though some used an economy of words.\n\nIn the three-way race for a seat on Hamilton County Commission, Christopher Smitherman, an independent candidate, said he respected his Republican opponent Matt O'Neill for being a small business owner and Democrat and incumbent Commissioner Stephanie Summerow Dumas because she \"has committed her adult life to service.\"\n\nHerschel Walker's senate campaign an embarrassment: Herschel Walker embodies every negative stereotype Black Americans have fought against for decades\n\nDumas said Smitherman \"seems to be committed to his children,\" and O'Neill is \"making the race interesting. Competition is always a good thing.\"\n\nO'Neill said he can see how Dumas' background as a social worker shows up in her work as a county commissioner. \"She is very concerned about the wellbeing of the citizens and health of the community,\" he said.\n\nAs for Smitherman, O'Neill said he was moved by his passion for his family. \"He mentions his kids in every campaign speech. You can tell that's how important his family is to him. He's a wonderful parent to his children and a loving father.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Goodin and Pavan Parikh who are competing for the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts job describe themselves as friends.\n\n\"We met because of mutual friends from our time in the Army,\" Parikh said. \"He's a good man and a good dad. I appreciate his passion for our community.\"\n\nGoodin said he had a high personal regard for Parikh, particularly as a father.\n\n\"I wish my kids were are well behaved as his seem to be,\" Goodin said with a laugh. \"He really seems to put in time with the family. I've seen where he's taken time off the campaign trail to deal with family matters, and that's a very good thing.\"\n\nTom Brinkman, the Republican candidate for Hamilton County Auditor, said he doesn't look at his Democratic challenger Brigid Kelly as \"the enemy.\"\n\n\"She's my opponent, but that's all. I get along with Brigid well,\" Brinkman said. He noted that Kelly and his wife have bonded as they both are dealing with health challenges.\n\nWho's ahead in AZ governor's race? Momentum moves to Kari Lake from Katie Hobbs in Arizona governor race\n\n\"My wife and her have sent cards back and forth between each other. My wife and I pray for her in what she's going through and I know she's been pulling for my wife in what she's going through.\"\n\nKelly referred to herself and Brinkman as \"unlikely friends.\" She said they don't agree on much but have always been able to have frank and honest conversations with each other, which has helped to build their relationship despite differing world views. Kelly said that type of connection matters and impacts how a person conducts his or herself in a campaign.\n\n\"It makes it more civil, which makes it more appealing to people who are turned off by elections,\" Kelly said. \"One thing I can say about Tom is you always know where he stands on things, right, wrong or indifferent.\"\n\nKelly added: \"A functional government is good for everybody. It's something we all should aspire to.\"\n\nBrinkman acknowledged that it can be hard to say positive things about an opponent sometimes because \"there are individuals in elected office, on both sides of the aisle, who are very hard to get along with. They don't have good intentions.\"\n\nBut the majority of officeholders, Brinkman said, are good people with good intentions who don't regard their opponents as \"evil.\"\n\n\"We get stuck in this us-against-them,\" he said. \"There are some people who are not good people in politics, but the vast majority are people just trying to do what they think the office calls for.

But it's worth taking a step back to consider what President Joe Biden's move on marijuana policy tells us about how democracy actually works.\n\nNo automatic mechanism converts public opinion into public policy. And even when opinion is reflected in policy, change tends to occur incrementally.\n\nThat's certainly been the case for marijuana. Very marginal steps toward legalization took place state by state working up to national policy change -- though Biden's pardons of people convicted of possession still falls far short of where the public is on this issue. One survey finds a solid 69% of Americans in favor of legalization.\n\nWhy does policy tend to lag behind public opinion? For one, it usually takes organized groups, especially those aligned with political parties, to bring about significant change. But advocacy for marijuana liberalization has been driven, by and large, by individuals.\n\nPeople are also reading... UNI punter Cael Loecher remains 'critically stable' at U of I Hospital MICU Brian Ferentz: Petras is best option at QB for Iowa Police investigating restaurant burglary in Waterloo Plymouth County farmland sells for record $26,250 per acre South Carolina crash kills Waterloo woman Omega announces layoffs Preps to Watch: Oct. 12, 2022 Woman charged after son found wandering naked Waterloo business moves out of mall to open downtown storefront Bluder doubts injured commit will play again One seriously injured following Cedar Falls crash Store employee arrested for lottery fraud Wanted sex offender detained in LaPorte City One arrested in apartment building fire College Football: Butler perseveres at UNI\n\nProponents of liberalization won enough support from groups aligned with the Democratic Party that decriminalization and other steps were included in their 2020 platform. Presidents and their parties tend to at least try to keep their campaign promises. That's what Biden is doing. They often fall short, as Biden has done on voting rights, because they don't have the votes in Congress or otherwise can't make things happen. But they do usually try.\n\nBiden also is moving cautiously because presidential action entails real risks -- for Biden, but also for the policy Democrats want. Presidential involvement on any issue tends to polarize public opinion. Because Democrats are already almost all in favor of legalization, nothing can be gained on that side.\n\nAt the same time, Republican voters who now support marijuana legalization may flip to opposing it once it's identified with a Democratic president. Opposing the president is such a strong impulse that it even has led to a surprising amount of Republican support for Russia and opposition to Ukraine in the current conflict.\n\nThis is also a tricky area to navigate for prominent Republicans. Normally, it's safe for them to simply oppose whatever Biden supports. But in this case, Biden is endorsing something already very popular, including among many Republican voters. As the midterms approach, Republicans could find their vocal opposition to Biden in general undermined by voter support for Biden's move on marijuana.\n\nThe current situation isn't unlike what happened with former President Barack Obama and marriage equality. The right to same-sex marriage was gaining in popularity, especially among Democrats, yet Obama feared the political consequences of moving ahead, and also had less ability to effect policy change.\n\nIt's doubtful that marijuana will make much difference in this fall's midterms. The issue unites Democrats (by a margin of 86% to 7% in a recent poll conducted by Civiqs, a public opinion firm) while splitting Republicans down the middle (45% to 43%), so there might be some room for Democrats to grab some Republican votes. But only so many people are open to flipping their planned vote at this point, and of those only a very limited number tell pollsters that marijuana policy is a high priority.\n\nIt was smart of Biden to wait for public opinion, rather than to try to lead it. The question now will be whether support for legal weed has become strong enough that presidential involvement will no longer matter. We'll see.\n\nBernstein is a Bloomberg News columnist covering politics and policy.

Many of these negative ads are misleading, and often distort or take out of context comments, actions or positions taken by a particular candidate. Worst of all, they leave voters exhausted and disillusioned with their choices, which, as politics columnist Dan Sewell said, can leave them \"holding their noses when they cast their ballots.\"\n\nIn these polarizing times, it's important to take a step back and clear the negativity from the air.

But McCain rejected the woman's attack on his opponent outright.\n\n\"No ma'am, he's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about,\" McCain said to applause.\n\nI wanted to find out if Greater Cincinnati politicians could play nice in the sandbox, as McCain did. If I asked those running for federal, state and local offices to say something nice or positive about their opponents, what might they say? Would they say anything at all?\n\nSo I called, emailed and texted as many candidates as I could, especially those in heated and contentious races, to get their responses. No one had a McCain moment, but all offered something positive about their opponents. The niceties came easier to some candidates than others, and most kept their responses brief. If there was an overriding theme, it was each candidate's respect for their opponent's commitment to family while also trying to serve their community/country.\n\nThere was no shortage of barbs and sharp attacks lobbed during the first public debate between Democrat Tim Ryan and Republican J.D. Vance on Monday. The two are locked in a hotly contested race for U.S. Senate that polls show is neck-and-neck as early voting begins. And while voters didn't get to hear it from the debate podium, the two men said they respect each other's commitment to family and service.\n\n\"I admire Tim Ryan's commitment to his family. It's clear that he always puts his wife and kids first,\" Vance said.\n\nDespite referring to Vance as an \"a-- kisser\" of former President Donald Trump multiple times during the debate, Ryan said he was \"grateful for J.D.'s service to our country as a U.S. Marine.\"\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine and former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley have proven they can be collegial, as the two worked together in the aftermath of a tragic mass shooting in Dayton in 2019 that left 10 people dead. While locked in a battle to be the state's next governor, Whaley said she appreciates DeWine as a family man.\n\n\"Governor DeWine cares deeply about his family and has always put them first,\" she said.\n\nCovering disabled people: Fetterman's accommodation request revealed the bias we still have against disabled people\n\nDeWine highlighted his interactions with Whaley during the COVID-19 pandemic, and her care for those she served while mayor.\n\n\"During the pandemic, when I held press conferences, which were often daily, I would call all of Ohio's big city mayors, including Mayor Whaley. I found that Mayor Whaley was concerned about people's lives and wellbeing,\" DeWine said. \"She was very candid in describing what she needed from us, and we always tried to deliver on that for her.\"\n\nIn the race for Ohio's 1st Congressional District seat, Republican Congressman Steve Chabot has developed somewhat of a reputation for negative campaigning. His opponent, Democrat Greg Landsman, has been on the receiving end of more than a few commercials painting him as a corrupt extremist who is anti-police and a tax-and-spend puppet of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDo we live in two Americas? Voters reward GOP for economics, but culture wars pull us apart.\n\nBeing characterized that way probably hasn't engendered many warm feelings toward Chabot. Still, Landsman offered this: \"I know firsthand how hard it can be to raise a family and serve in public life. While we disagree on many issues, the Congressman has managed to balance a public career with raising his family. That merits respect.\"\n\nGot any other good things to say about your opponent, Mr. Landsman?\n\n\"We're both bald,\" he quipped.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nAside from being follicly challenged family men, Chabot shared something else he has in common with Landsman.\n\n\"I respect that Mr. Landsman was a teacher. As a former teacher myself, I know both how demanding and how important that job can be. So, he, and all our dedicated teachers, deserve our gratitude for the time and hard work they've committed to our nation's children.\"\n\nCandidates in county races were more amenable to saying something positive about their opponent (local races tend to not be as contentious as national ones), though some used an economy of words.\n\nIn the three-way race for a seat on Hamilton County Commission, Christopher Smitherman, an independent candidate, said he respected his Republican opponent Matt O'Neill for being a small business owner and Democrat and incumbent Commissioner Stephanie Summerow Dumas because she \"has committed her adult life to service.\"\n\nHerschel Walker's senate campaign an embarrassment: Herschel Walker embodies every negative stereotype Black Americans have fought against for decades\n\nDumas said Smitherman \"seems to be committed to his children,\" and O'Neill is \"making the race interesting. Competition is always a good thing.\"\n\nO'Neill said he can see how Dumas' background as a social worker shows up in her work as a county commissioner. \"She is very concerned about the wellbeing of the citizens and health of the community,\" he said.\n\nAs for Smitherman, O'Neill said he was moved by his passion for his family. \"He mentions his kids in every campaign speech. You can tell that's how important his family is to him. He's a wonderful parent to his children and a loving father.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Goodin and Pavan Parikh who are competing for the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts job describe themselves as friends.\n\n\"We met because of mutual friends from our time in the Army,\" Parikh said. \"He's a good man and a good dad. I appreciate his passion for our community.\"\n\nGoodin said he had a high personal regard for Parikh, particularly as a father.\n\n\"I wish my kids were are well behaved as his seem to be,\" Goodin said with a laugh. \"He really seems to put in time with the family. I've seen where he's taken time off the campaign trail to deal with family matters, and that's a very good thing.\"\n\nTom Brinkman, the Republican candidate for Hamilton County Auditor, said he doesn't look at his Democratic challenger Brigid Kelly as \"the enemy.\"\n\n\"She's my opponent, but that's all. I get along with Brigid well,\" Brinkman said. He noted that Kelly and his wife have bonded as they both are dealing with health challenges.\n\nWho's ahead in AZ governor's race? Momentum moves to Kari Lake from Katie Hobbs in Arizona governor race\n\n\"My wife and her have sent cards back and forth between each other. My wife and I pray for her in what she's going through and I know she's been pulling for my wife in what she's going through.\"\n\nKelly referred to herself and Brinkman as \"unlikely friends.\" She said they don't agree on much but have always been able to have frank and honest conversations with each other, which has helped to build their relationship despite differing world views. Kelly said that type of connection matters and impacts how a person conducts his or herself in a campaign.\n\n\"It makes it more civil, which makes it more appealing to people who are turned off by elections,\" Kelly said. \"One thing I can say about Tom is you always know where he stands on things, right, wrong or indifferent.\"\n\nKelly added: \"A functional government is good for everybody. It's something we all should aspire to.\"\n\nBrinkman acknowledged that it can be hard to say positive things about an opponent sometimes because \"there are individuals in elected office, on both sides of the aisle, who are very hard to get along with. They don't have good intentions.\"\n\nBut the majority of officeholders, Brinkman said, are good people with good intentions who don't regard their opponents as \"evil.\"\n\n\"We get stuck in this us-against-them,\" he said. \"There are some people who are not good people in politics, but the vast majority are people just trying to do what they think the office calls for. I don't think that makes them bad.\"\n\nGoodin sees things similarly.\n\n\"People lose track of our common humanity,\" Goodin said. \"They forget that there are actual people on the other side of these political arguments.\"\n\nHuman decency is something Parikh doesn't ever want to overlook, even when he's in campaign mode. He said he wishes Goodin well in everything he does - except this election, of course.\n\n\"Obviously, I don't want him to take my job,\" Parikh said with a laugh. \"We can pick up our friendship where we left off after the election.\"\n\nWouldn't it be great if everyone - politicians and voters alike - could do the same?\n\nOpinion and Engagement Editor Kevin S.

Follow this author to stay notified about their latest stories. Got it!\n\nFormer President Barack Obama announced plans Saturday for three midterm campaign stops this month, bringing star power Democrats hope will boost their candidates' chances in a series of extremely tight races.\n\nObama was similarly a rare sight during the 2020 campaign, not appearing at an event for then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden until October 21. His most recent rally appearances were a year ago for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, but both races brought disappointing outcomes for Democrats -- Virginia Democratic nominee and former governor Terry McAuliffe lost in an upset to Glenn Youngkin (R), and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) performed well below expectations, narrowly beating Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But many Democrats believe Obama remains the party's best asset, despite concerns he is still a polarizing figure that can rile up Republican opposition. Obama left office in 2017 with an approval rating of about 51%, according to FiveThirtyEight, far higher than the 42.3% approval mark Biden now holds.\n\n\"We have to show up this election for the Governors, Secretaries of State and the candidates down the ballot who are going to protect voting rights and our electoral process,\" Obama tweeted Saturday.\n\nDemocrats won't get as much Obama as they want in the midterms.

Several Republicans who want to upend the way votes are cast and counted are also running for top election administrator offices in their states.\n\nObama will tell voters that Democrats are the party for protecting abortion rights but a main theme in his appearances will also be that Democrats can be better trusted to keep elections fair, with the next presidential contest slated for 2024.\n\n\"He looks forward to stumping for candidates up and down the ballot, especially in races and states that will have consequences for the administration of 2024 elections,\" Obama's office said in a statement.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a Republican, is also holding campaign events to support Republicans, with the rallies featuring speeches in which he has repeatedly hinted he might run for president again in 2024.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed that he lost the 2020 presidential contest to Democrat Joe Biden because of fraud.\n\nRepublicans who back Trump's false claim have become their party's nominees for top election officials in states that could play decisive roles in the 2024 contest.\n\nRepublicans Jim Marchant of Nevada and Mark Finchem of Arizona, for example, want to curtail or abolish early voting, mail-in voting and ballot drop-boxes, claiming without evidence that they breed fraud.\n\nVoting groups are concerned that the election of some far right candidates could threaten the integrity of the next presidential election. There are fears some might help Trump - if he decides to run again - or another like-minded Republican to overturn election results in 2024.\n\nIn an interview on his podcast released on Saturday, Obama said Democrats might not be able to trust that U.S. courts will keep elections fair. That means Democrats must hold offices in closely-contested states to ensure the results of elections will be respected, he said.\n\n\"Because it may turn out that in a close presidential election at some point, certification of an election in a key swing state may be at issue.

But it's worth taking a step back to consider what President Joe Biden's move on marijuana policy tells us about how democracy actually works.\n\nNo automatic mechanism converts public opinion into public policy. And even when opinion is reflected in policy, change tends to occur incrementally.\n\nThat's certainly been the case for marijuana. Very marginal steps toward legalization took place state by state working up to national policy change -- though Biden's pardons of people convicted of possession still falls far short of where the public is on this issue. One survey finds a solid 69% of Americans in favor of legalization.\n\nWhy does policy tend to lag behind public opinion? For one, it usually takes organized groups, especially those aligned with political parties, to bring about significant change. But advocacy for marijuana liberalization has been driven, by and large, by individuals.\n\nPeople are also reading...

What you need to know South Napa's Imola park-and-ride lot is reborn\n\nProponents of liberalization won enough support from groups aligned with the Democratic Party that decriminalization and other steps were included in their 2020 platform. Presidents and their parties tend to at least try to keep their campaign promises. That's what Biden is doing. They often fall short, as Biden has done on voting rights, because they don't have the votes in Congress or otherwise can't make things happen. But they do usually try.\n\nBiden also is moving cautiously because presidential action entails real risks -- for Biden, but also for the policy Democrats want. Presidential involvement on any issue tends to polarize public opinion. Because Democrats are already almost all in favor of legalization, nothing can be gained on that side.\n\nAt the same time, Republican voters who now support marijuana legalization may flip to opposing it once it's identified with a Democratic president. Opposing the president is such a strong impulse that it even has led to a surprising amount of Republican support for Russia and opposition to Ukraine in the current conflict.\n\nThis is also a tricky area to navigate for prominent Republicans. Normally, it's safe for them to simply oppose whatever Biden supports. But in this case, Biden is endorsing something already very popular, including among many Republican voters. As the midterms approach, Republicans could find their vocal opposition to Biden in general undermined by voter support for Biden's move on marijuana.\n\nThe current situation isn't unlike what happened with former President Barack Obama and marriage equality. The right to same-sex marriage was gaining in popularity, especially among Democrats, yet Obama feared the political consequences of moving ahead, and also had less ability to effect policy change.\n\nIt's doubtful that marijuana will make much difference in this fall's midterms. The issue unites Democrats (by a margin of 86% to 7% in a recent poll conducted by Civiqs, a public opinion firm) while splitting Republicans down the middle (45% to 43%), so there might be some room for Democrats to grab some Republican votes.
